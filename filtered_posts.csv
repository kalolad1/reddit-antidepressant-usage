Getting my laughter and sense of joy back with citalopram ,"I started citalopram again almost 2 weeks ago for anxiety, depression, and OCD and after some brutal side effects Iâ€™ve finally noticed a positive change. I know it takes 3-4 weeks for it to start taking full effect, but, I canâ€™t deny the bit of joy Iâ€™m finally starting to find again. For years Iâ€™ve felt like I donâ€™t really laugh much or it takes a lot to actually spark a laugh. Yesterday my boyfriend and I went to an amusement park and the amount of giggles I was getting on the rides was something I havenâ€™t experienced for so long. Like uncontrollable amounts. Heâ€™s also noticed it in general conversations and that Iâ€™m starting to find my joy again. Iâ€™m really happy that I took the steps to be medicated again and improve my quality of life. I finally feel like I deserve it :â€™)",0
Can 10mg of Citalopram a day can cause serotonin syndrome?,"Been on it for more than a week. I haven't experienced side effects other than insomnia, but today afternoon I started to feel extremely tired and a bit dizzy. Then a few hours later I felt really hot and weak and sweating like hell (it's not hot at all inside, I have AC running). 
I feel a bit better now, but my BP is 145 (usually between 110 and 125 for me)

I'm worried as hell and started shaking. Will this shit kill me?",1
Tapering off Celexa question,"So I have been taking Celexa 40mg for about 15 years for generalized anxiety disorder. When I first started it I was having terrible anxiety and panic attacks. That went away but the whole time I have always maintained a mild anxiety that I feel I can live with. Tried Effexor and Zoloft and they didn't help about 10 years ago.

So I decided to come off them. For the past 1.5 months I have went from 40 > 30 > 20 > 10 > now 5mg tonight. The whole time I have had zero symptoms and no worsening of anxiety. So my question is, how low should I go before stopping altogether? I am taking 5mg because I have 10mg pills that are easy to cut in half. But after that I don't know what to do.

Any help would be appreciated. My psychologist has retired.

Thanks.",2
Has anyone tried Celexa?,"Ikr doctor just prescribed me 20mg of celexa and I just started taking it yesterday:. When I took it this morning, i felt super nauseous so I ate something to calm my stomach. I havenâ€™t thrown up but Iâ€™ve been nauseous on and off all day today. Is this normal? Will it go away?? I donâ€™t feel that great. I know itâ€™s TMI but my stomach is all messed up today too and I normally  ðŸ’© once a day but since I took my medicine, Iâ€™ve had 5 loose stools today. ",3
Citalopram,"Hey Iâ€™ve been on citalopram for like 2 months now - before I started taking it I really struggled with falling asleep but now I literally sleep every night for 15 hours - I find it impossible to wake myself up at the right time and Iâ€™m tired even after I wake up 

Is anyone on here prescribed citalopram for depression/anxiety and if so do you have this problem ",4
