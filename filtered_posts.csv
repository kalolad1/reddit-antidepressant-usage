Getting my laughter and sense of joy back with citalopram ,"I started citalopram again almost 2 weeks ago for anxiety, depression, and OCD and after some brutal side effects I‚Äôve finally noticed a positive change. I know it takes 3-4 weeks for it to start taking full effect, but, I can‚Äôt deny the bit of joy I‚Äôm finally starting to find again. For years I‚Äôve felt like I don‚Äôt really laugh much or it takes a lot to actually spark a laugh. Yesterday my boyfriend and I went to an amusement park and the amount of giggles I was getting on the rides was something I haven‚Äôt experienced for so long. Like uncontrollable amounts. He‚Äôs also noticed it in general conversations and that I‚Äôm starting to find my joy again. I‚Äôm really happy that I took the steps to be medicated again and improve my quality of life. I finally feel like I deserve it :‚Äô)",0
Can 10mg of Citalopram a day can cause serotonin syndrome?,"Been on it for more than a week. I haven't experienced side effects other than insomnia, but today afternoon I started to feel extremely tired and a bit dizzy. Then a few hours later I felt really hot and weak and sweating like hell (it's not hot at all inside, I have AC running). 
I feel a bit better now, but my BP is 145 (usually between 110 and 125 for me)

I'm worried as hell and started shaking. Will this shit kill me?",1
Crying on Citalopram,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been on Citalopram since 9/14 this year and was starting to feel more like myself in the evenings but the past few days I‚Äôve felt a more depressed than usual. I had a random crying spell before bed last night and woke up feeling awful as well. Citalopram has helped get me out of constant fight or flight but how long in your experience does it work for depression?",2
Citalopram long term side effects,"Have been on citalopram for around 3 years now. 
I was a healthy, active woman- 5ft 9in and around 9stone -9stone 5lbs. 
Since taking Citalopram I have ballooned up to over 11stone, have lost all desire to work out, feel fatigued all the time and have no self control when it comes to diet. 
I came off citalopram when I was pregnant and actually lost over a stone and then once my baby was born and I went back on it, I put all the weight back on.
I take Citalopram to control my PMDD related mood swings but I feel like I need to come off it because it is really starting to affect my quality of life.
I can‚Äôt say I feel happier or calmer ( I did for a while) just very demotivated and tired. 
I am not sure if it‚Äôs the citalopram causing all of this, as I have been anaemic in the past and needed blood transfusions and my iron levels rise and fall, but the last few times I have had blood tests, they have come back okay.
I just want to know of others experience with Citalopram and the long term side effects you suffer?",3

Coming off citalopram symptoms?,"Hi all! I (22f) am trying to come off citalopram because it causes some side effects that I can no longer cope with. I‚Äôve been on it for about 3 years. I also take propranolol for anxiety.

I usually take 30mg and for the last few (four or so) days following a doctors advice I‚Äôve been taking 20mg. The issue I have is that I have very bad health anxiety and I don‚Äôt know whether the ‚Äúside effects‚Äù I‚Äôm having are real or not. Has anyone come off it in the past and can tell me about their experience?

Thank you in advance!",5
Citalopram alternatives,"My psychiatrist prescribed me citalopram 10mg daily on top of my Wellbutrin. I loved the citalopram. Made me feel like myself again and I started back sleeping. For once my brain was quiet as well. Long story short, I‚Äôm allergic to it. Does anyone take anything that‚Äôs helped them that‚Äôs equivalent to citalopram?",6
Citalopram/Celexa fatigue,"I have been on celexa for about a year now. I remember in the beginning I had fatigue kinda bad but that was expected. Now, a year in, I fall asleep once or twice a day. It feels like I literally cannot fight the fatigue when it hits me. And half of the time I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôve fallen asleep until I wake up. And I‚Äôm sure I could fall asleep standing if I wanted to. It‚Äôs so bad. And I hate it. It makes me miss out on time with my son because my fianc√© will let me sleep, which I‚Äôm grateful for, but I‚Äôm tired of sleeping my days away. 

Idk if this will help at all but I am 23(F). I‚Äôve been fighting depression and anxiety for 3 years now and this is my third medication. And I take my medication at night before I go to bed.",7
Coming off Citalopram,"I‚Äôve been on Citalopram (40mg) for nearly three years, and haven‚Äôt felt any improvements. I now want to stop taking them, but cold turkey. 
What side-effects will I likely suffer from, and for how long?",8
Switching from Citalopram to Sertraline.,"So a GP initially recommended that I taper of citalopram, by reducing the dose in 10mg increments weekly, then move onto 50mg sertraline. Another GP said that it was possible just to switch directly, which I have now done. So i changed from 30mg citalopram to 50mg sertraline. The first few days were OK, till about day 3/4 where I started feeling really nauseous and dizzy, but not intolerable. Its nearly been a week now and am still feeling pretty sick most of the time. Has anyone had a similar experience? 

Also could it be the withdrawal from the citalopram, or the starting of the sertraline or a combo of both? 

Thanks üòä",9

I will have a few bites of something or ill smell it and not want to eat it I also feel like I am going to throw up. for anyone that is on this medication. what foods do you recommend eating or ways I can get nutrition in my body if I am unable to eat .,10

"Citalopram causing clot, backpain?",I've had unexplained backpain in between shoulder blades. I've not been sure where this has come from. Could it be from Citalopram. I also seemed to have testicle pain and a weird bruise which I am not sure was from anything physical. Has anyone had similar experiences.,12
Weaned off Citalopram,"Has anyone been weaned off citalopram and if so how long did it take for he withdrawal symptoms to end? I was on 40 mg for three years. After lots of counseling, my doctor and I agreed to wean off the medication as I‚Äôd like to get pregnant in the next year. We slowly reduced and I‚Äôve been totally off for about 2 weeks. But I‚Äôm having the weirdest dreams at night. I can‚Äôt explain them. And now when I wake up I have a jolt of anxiety. We‚Äôre going to monitor it for a few weeks to see if I need to go back on. But I‚Äôm curious what peoples experiences were if they weaned off anxiety medication",13
Citalopram and bizarre dreams.,"hello there, I just woke up from the scariest and most bizarre nightmare in my life, I knew it was a dream and I was trapped in there trying to do anything to wake up but I couldn't until I finally decided to jump from a building in the dream and I finally woke up. Vivid dreams occurs daily to me but this was the most intense and my question is does the citalopram do all that or I do have another problem? also what can I do to reduce the frequency of this dreams I missed my non sense dreams üò≠",14
Citalopram withdrawals suck and my doctor isn‚Äôt helping,"Been on it for 4 years on a 20mcg dose, been coming off of it for 6 weeks to switch onto Mirtazapine.

However, my doctor isn‚Äôt weaning me in a standard way. They put me down to 10mcg spaced out over the 6 weeks, so I don‚Äôt get withdrawals for 4-5 days before I get extremely dizzy and fatigued. Instead of weaning me down to 5mcg and then 2.5, I‚Äôm not allowed any more and I got prescribed an anti-dizziness medicine. Surely I should still be weaned? I feel like crap trying to tough it out. Is what my doc did normal? I‚Äôm in the UK if it matters.",15
Do Citalopram and Quetiapine work together ok?,"As the title says do these 2 work together I have been on them for 6 months and feel no different,also  the Zopiclone does not get me to sleep for long 2/3 hours tops also self-harming is at a extreme not deep cuts but a few hundred at a time.",16

Will Citalopram always make me tired?,"I started taking citalopram to help me with my anxiety, depression and to help me get off ativan. It's definitely helped, but now I feel so tired all the time. I'm not sure what dose it is, but I think it's the lowest dose. I've been taking it for six weeks and although it doesn't make me sleep as such, I feel very lethargic. Is there anything I can do to counter this? Please don't tell me to ""ask my doctor"". This is the first thing I would do if I had that option.",18
Anxiety Disorder - Setraline and Citalopram,"Hi, I hope (not) somebody had similar problem as I. I have drug induced anxiety disorder with panic attacks. I imidiately was prescribed with Sertraline 50 mg. I took for the first week 25 mg and then I increased to 50 mg. After one week on incresed dose I felt pretty good - I had some blurred vision and some other side effects but they weren't that bad and I was feeling better every day. Then after one week on 50 mg I stardet to feel different side effects (like nausea which I didn't have before) and the worst is that my blurry vision worsened and it is difficult for me to talk to my freinds in one room because I am really struggling to see sharply things in far. I see my psychiatrist on 23 March but my regular doctor say that if the side effetcts doesn't go away he will change me my meds on Wednesday (it will be over two weeks taking 50 mg). He wants to change to Citalopram/escitalopram. I am afraid to waste so much time (this 3 weeks are the worst nigthmare to me, and I went thru it because I was improving). Is it possible that my meds ""loaded"" after one week and that is the cause that my side effects worsened? Has anyone experienced that? I am afraid to change meds because I don't want to have lost another month in my life. Have you changed from Setraline to Citalopram after 3 weeks? Was  it hard? I really need your support because I fell so trapped (I feel bad now on Sertraline but I don't want to change it to feel bad again). Thank you for all your comments",19
Tapering off Celexa question,"So I have been taking Celexa 40mg for about 15 years for generalized anxiety disorder. When I first started it I was having terrible anxiety and panic attacks. That went away but the whole time I have always maintained a mild anxiety that I feel I can live with. Tried Effexor and Zoloft and they didn't help about 10 years ago.

So I decided to come off them. For the past 1.5 months I have went from 40 > 30 > 20 > 10 > now 5mg tonight. The whole time I have had zero symptoms and no worsening of anxiety. So my question is, how low should I go before stopping altogether? I am taking 5mg because I have 10mg pills that are easy to cut in half. But after that I don't know what to do.

Any help would be appreciated. My psychologist has retired.

Thanks.",20
Has anyone tried Celexa?,"Ikr doctor just prescribed me 20mg of celexa and I just started taking it yesterday:.

celexa concerns,"Hi 34/f here. 
I've been using celexa for awhile now and it's been helping with my anxiety and depression. But I've been fearful about increasing my dose, as suggested by my psychiatrist, because of weight issues. During the time I've been taking celexa (a little over a yr) I have gained a good 15lbs, and now weigh the most I ever have in my life.
My question is has anyone else experienced more of a weight increase when increasing celexa dose?",23
Question about stopping celexa after 6 days and taking 5htp instead,"I‚Äôve been taking celexa for depression for 6 or 7 days now and it‚Äôs giving me extreme anxiety that I didn‚Äôt have before along with other symptoms such as hot flashes and sweating. 

I tried 5htp right before I started taking it and it helped immediately but the 2nd or 3rd day of taking it I had a weird episode of maybe depersonalization or something so I took a buspar from an old rx I had and it fixed it so I figured the 5htp was maybe depleting my dopamine and that‚Äôs why it helped. 

I‚Äôve read you need to take 5htp with l tyrosine to increase dopamine so I‚Äôm wanting to try this because I‚Äôm hating celexa. 

Has anyone else ever stopped celexa after a few days and introduced 5htp and l tyrosine??",24

Intrusive thoughts or something else?,"Hi,

I was wondering if someone also experience intrusive thoughts like i do. For example i think of i get myself a coffee and then suddenly the word ketchup comes along in my mind. Or I thought about this mosquitos are annoying but then birds came in my mind. Sometimes my mind also gets stuck on thoughts i had a few seconds or minutes before. I recently have been diagnosed with intrusive thoughts and i take 20mg of paxil since two weeks now (Half a year ago i had ptsd and took celexa for half a year, i stopped celexa and 4 weeks later this new issue began). Have you ever had such intrusive thoughts because I haven't read about that yet and I have been searching for already 2 weeks now. Sometimes i also combine words or have slight speech problems, can this also be a symptom of intrusive or racing thoughts.

Thank you for your answers and sorry for my bad english",33

tried to come off escitalopram,"hi!! i was 18 when i first started taking medication. i was on 30mg of citalopram for approximately 6 years, and then switched to escitalopram and have been on it since. back in november/december i decided i wanted to attempt to come off and my doctor has reduced my dosage since. she told me to stay at 5mg for 3 weeks and then i could start coming off. so friday was my last day on it. 
last night i had the worst depression episode in years. i cried for 2 hours, wallowed in my sadness, laid in the dark in bed and decided to just go to sleep at 830. i had brain zaps alllll day for the past 3 days and its just so frustrating.

Is not that I want to feel sad, but I went through a very big disappointment and is something that I should be crying about, but I'm not. Crying is something that really makes me relieved sometimes and I just think that if I was able to cry a bit over that situation I would feel better.

"What next: Escitalopram, Sertraline or Amitriptyline? None?","So, my psychiatrist once suggested Escitalopram as my depressions were at the worst. However, I Pregabalin was given to me against (nerve) pain but the Pregabalin made me, I believe, even more suicidal and highly agitated. It did help against the pain though.

It's a rather complicated story with my health which started three years ago. A year ago, after one week of Mirtazapine I got excrutiating pain in my limbs and vein issues. After that I got Pregabalin. I believe this had a connection to Covid actually and was not the Mirtazapine on its own.

Now, my pain subsided in the last weeks but my depression is still present. I wanted to discuss with my psychiatrist what to try and if I should at all. Escitalopram, Sertraline and Amitriptyline were on my mind.

I do fear negative (permanent) side effects from them though (there is this PSSD syndrome I heard of) looking back at my Mirtazapine reaction. Any suggestions or thoughts would be highly welcomed. I believe I don't have the mental capacity for good decision making for this right now.",42
Restarted Escitalopram,I‚Äôve been on and off with my medication recently cos of work and stress. But I recently restarted it. Today precisely. But I feel TERRIBLE.

How can I lose weight on Escitalopram and Mirtazapine?,"Hello everyone, since I have problems with my anxiety, today I was prescribed Escitalopram(10g) and Mirtazapine(15g). 

I started practicing alternate day fasting a month ago and now got used to it. Also, I go to the gym and make some cardio exercises but unfortunately it‚Äôs not very regularly.

How should I manage social interaction while starting to take Escitalopram?,"Hello, I (27M) have to start to take Escitalopram 5mg because I have been diagnosed with cumulative ptsd. I had a very difficult time but with therapy and now with the help of these pills I‚Äôm looking forward to a strong recovery. I have a beautiful job (I teach in middle school), I play in a band and I serve as a volunteer paramedic and live in one of the most beautiful regions of the world - Italian alps: I‚Äôm quite happy with my life right now. 
My issue is that even if things are good atm, I have to be very careful because I am all the time at risk of rebounding and get badly depressed and aggressive because of my childhood trauma and because of the difficult time I just went through about a year ago. The social interactions I have thanks to the activities I make are very nice but they very often include a lot of alcohol, and I know I should not drink while on the Escitalopram. I will take the first pill tomorrow and the next two weekends I will be playing with my band abroad and after concerts there sure will be a lot of partying and alcohol. So now I‚Äôm asking for your advice: should I drop some activities like the band in order to have a calmer life and especially in order to stop drinking? Is it recommended to sacrifice some social activities for the sake of a slower life with maybe less social interactions but ones of better quality? I feel a bit at a crossroad at my life where I have to rally take a decision to improve my quality of life especially because I now have everything I need for a happy and decent life, but I‚Äôm not sure which the right direction is. 
I‚Äôm looking forward to read all of your answers, thank you in advance :)",45

"I took more than prescribed Lexapro/Escitalopram lastnight, struggling to not do it again tonight","**Question:**   
Hi, so I don't want to really get into it but I took more than my prescribed dose of this medicine almost 24 hours ago. I am a minor. I normally take a 20mg pill, however I took around 6 (Guessing as I did not count). I know this is not fatal, at least the amount I took, as I have done a similar thing before, although I believe I had worse side effects. (Maybe I took a pill or so more).  
  
My symptoms today were; intense shaking in the morning, weakness + dizziness when standing, random dizziness, seeing things that aren't there, nausea, drowsiness, and the occasional painful feeling that the back of my mouth (throat) is tightening.  
I am generally not to concerned of these side-effects however I was having pain below my belly button to my gentiles and I seem to be a bit constipated. I've had a similar pain before on just a random normal day although it never reached farther than just a bit below my belly button.  
  
**Are there any possible long term effects that this medication could have? Could this cause any serious organ or intestinal damage?**  


**Vent:**  
   I am afraid to tell my parents, and I don't think they would let me stay home from school if I were to tell them I am having a bad mental health day. Today I could barley focus let alone stay awake in my classes, and tomorrow, well I don't know how that will turn out.

Escitalopram makes me foggy and tired. Is there an alternative I can ask my doctor for?,"Basically what the title says.

Has anyone taken an alternative that I can ask my doctor about?",48
I need help about depression and start using Escitalopram and Aripiprazole or not...,"Hello, I am 30 years old, and since childhood there were a series of problems in my life, and since I was about 16 years old, various mental conflicts caused my bad mood, depression and drug use.
Since I was about 18 years old, I have been taking 1 mg of clonazepam every night until now, when I really feel that it has very harmful effects and side effects, and it is really bothering me, and I really want to stop taking this pill, but it is really difficult.
I have been taking morphine continuously for the last 6 years.
For the past 3 years, I have been taking 20 mg of methadone a day, and now I have completely quit morphine and methadone for about two months.
The biggest problems I have now are:
I have never been my true self since I was young, and I still am not, and I am afraid that I have shown my true self, and I have limited myself since I was young, and I still do, and I do not like the character that I created for myself at all, and I am sick of it, and I have no self-confidence.
I hate myself and I know that I must change, but I have been involved in this issue for a long time and I cannot change and be comfortable with myself.
My concentration is very low and my mind is constantly thinking and only negative thoughts flow in my mind, which I have no control over.
I have no motivation and hope to do anything.
I have no passion and taste.
I rarely enjoy the things I should enjoy.
I have no motivation to improve myself.
My body is very weak, but I don't do anything, even though I know I must exercise.
I kind of gave up and suicidal thoughts have always been with me for several years and I really want to die.
I really want to just take drugs sometimes and sleep without being in this world.
Lately, I want to take methadone and clonazepam again and be in the world of self-denial.
But there is still a part of me that wants to get better, but it has become very weak lately.
It's very strange to me that I can't even start a little exercise!
After quitting methadone, the psychiatrist prescribed Escitalopram and Aripiprazole for me, but I have no trust in these doctors and these pills at all, and I think they have very very low effect and have very bad side effects, but I feel so bad that a part of me wants to give up and start taking the pills, but I have a problem, although they must be used for a long period of time, and on the other hand, I would like to try the microdose of magic mushrooms, but if I take these pills, I can't do that anymore.
Even now, because I am taking clonazepam and before that I was taking methadone, I did not start microdosing magic mushrooms.
I have taken SSRI and Nortriptyline before, but they had very little effect and did not make me feel better, it just made it easier for me to live this way.
And I forgot to say that I have been taking Quetiapine 25mg every night for about 4 years.
I used to take a higher dose, but now there is only 25 mg, and I will soon quit this pill, and I don't even know what harmful effects this pill has had on me in the past few years, I know this about clonazepam.
As for mushrooms, my life is divided into two parts: before a high-dose mushroom trip and after that, that trip really changed me and made me improve a lot and become better, but unfortunately, I went down a path I shouldn't have followed for a while, and my condition has gotten worse recently.
Now I can't start anything and it's like my mind is somehow locked that I want to make a series of moves to get better and it's a few years have we been like this.
I thought that I would get better after quitting methadone and started exercising, but I only got worse now and my body weakness is much more visible, which is really annoying.
I welcome any advice and help regarding about quitting clonazepam.
And whether to take Escitalopram and Aripiprazole or not?!!
Whether to try the mushroom microdose when I am also taking clonazepam or not.
I really do not know what to do!
I just want to feel better.
I just wanna exercise, meet new people, have plans for myself, playing my electric guitar again, read books, the improvement of my concentration that I lost, not to thinking all the time and no control on my thoughts and many other things like these stuff.",49
Day 20 on Escitalopram and my anxiety is getting worse.,"22 M, I was prescribed an SSRI antidepressant and a sedative (Alprazolam) for depression and anxiety, I'm on 20mg a day + 0.5mg of Alprazolam daily. After almost 2 weeks on Escitalopram, I started feeling better, but it's been 5 days now that I wake up very anxious everyday like clockwork and my anxiety spikes at random times for no reason. Does it get better?

Anyone who has withdrew from Lexapro (escitalopram),"Sorry if I'm not doing this right or if I'm in the wrong Reddit my mind isn't the clearest right now. I'm having a tough time and it seems like it may be me withdrawing from my Lexapro but I'm not sure. So back story medications I'm on currently are Wellbutrin 150mg in the morning adn Strattera (whatever the lowest mg is) along with 10 mg of Lexapro at night. 3 weeks ago I started the Strattera and actually lowered the Lexapro from 20mg/day to 10mg/day do to other side effects. I went through the initial stages of withdrawal of the Lexapro, ie: the headaches, tinnitus, irritability. A lot of that had tapered off and become less severe but I have been severely depressed for the last week or so. I'm curious if this could still be a side effect of not. If you need me to clarify anything let me know.",51
Scary Experience With Medication: Sudden Onset Suicide Ideation and Dark Thoughts with Clonazepam and/or Escitalopram. Thoughts?,"To be very clear from the start, I'm not planning to kill myself, but wanted to talk about a fear that I have.

I am more or less on 3 medications at once to fix 2 primary issues I have: Extreme anxiety (especially social anxiety) and what I believe to be undiagnosed ADHD.

For Anxiety:

* Clonazepam 0.25mg

  * I was prescribed Clonazepam for anxiety relief. I believe it works pretty effectively even on the small 0.25mg dosage Im on

* Escitalopram 10mg

  * I believe I was prescribed the for anxiety and depression and this should take 4-8 weeks to kick in (I'm about 2 and a half weeks into this)

For ADHD:

* Adderall XR 10mg

  * I believe I was prescribed this for the adhd (they say the plan is to increase this every 2 weeks until I get the desired effect). So far I think it *might* be helping??? but its too close to placebo to call effective. I have noticed feeling less hungry though, which is great.

---

Ok, context out of the way, what are my fears?

The recommended instructions for Clonazepam say to take 2 per day as needed (which I assume to mean that I don't take it on days I am not in anxiety filled situations. The psychiatrist said they expect Ill take one a day in the morning (where I said the most anxiety comes usually from a scheduled work meeting).

The last weekend I did so anyways, but this weekend did not.

This monday morning early morning like 3AM (I didn't really get much sleep so this is when I woke up), I felt fucking awful. Like I lay there anxious as I've ever been with no particular thoughts about anything anxiety inducing in particular but just kept thinking ""I should just fucking kill myself and be done with it"" and dreaming of the blissful lack of pain/fade to white and then nothing at the end of jumping off a tall building.

The whole time I realized this was super unhealthy and uncharacteristically strong. Like for the past ... over a decade of my life I have generally been depressed and thought casually , but never with strong emotion about it, and I still maintain that my plan is to only see it as an option when my options for trying to treat it seem like they are running out (in practical terms meaning that after I've tried with at least one more psychiatrist if this doesn't work out, gotten a psychologist I vibe with this psychiatrist etc) I would throw in the towel.

Anyhow my point here is, for around 2 weeks I have been much less anxiety filled and have had a much less depressed mood than normal with hope for my future given the positive effects I had seen with both the Adderall and Clonazepam. I don't feel like I was actually at any danger of killing myself, but the emotion to do so so suddenly despite my the previous 2 weeks or so of a heightened mood has me worried about my medications.

Is it the Escitalopram with the rare side effects of suicide ideation or is it my not taking clonazepam for one day? 
 I knew clonazepam built up dependency, but is it that quickly??? 

I don't know the answers to any of those, but it was genuinely extremely scary. Like someone had pointed a depression/anxiety-anator at my head and pulled the trigger.

Has anyone experienced anything like this?

I think I'm going to continue taking everything as prescribed every day, and bring this up with my psychiatrist when I meet them again next week, but I thought Id leave this here with the hopes to get some opinions, thoughts, and potentially some information for anyone who runs into my situation in the future and wonders if they are alone in this.",52
Lexapro Withdrawal,"I've been taking Lexapro 10mg for at least the last 2 years. I ran out recently and was unable to request a refill from my doctor's office (long story) so I decided that since I was planning on discontinuing it sooner rather than later, that I would take this as an opportunity to stop taking it. Now believe me, I KNOW quitting an antidepressant like Lexapro cold turkey is never a good idea, but it was out of my control.   
The withdrawal symptoms (brain zaps when I look in either direction horizontally, dizziness, irritability, random crying spells, etc) are truly awful. It's been about a week since I stopped taking it, so I'm hoping the worst of it will be over within the next week, but I'm not sure what to expect. I'm hoping someone else here has experience with quitting -whether cold turkey or not- who can tell me what their experience was and how long it took for the withdrawal symptoms to go away or at least become non-debilitating.

First day on Lexapro,"First day

I started having panic attacks a few weeks ago and my doctor prescribed me 10mg.

I took it for the first time yesterday and really didn‚Äôt like how it made me feel.

I took it in the morning and felt like something was ‚Äúhappening‚Äù within the first 30 minutes.

At first it felt kind of fuzzy, then a bit spacey after a few hours, then fine normal but by 7pm I feel panicky/high/nauseous.

I ended up just trying to go to sleep at 8:30.

Lexapro. I‚Äôm so disheartened.,"
So I started lexapro 13 months ago and It‚Äôs worked well up until recently. The past couple of months I‚Äôve been dealing with increased anxiety manifesting itself in tremors, hyperventilation, and even puking at times. My issue is that I only started it just over a year ago, and I hate switching medications. I feel like It‚Äôs too early to switch. It‚Äôs so hard trying to find a new medication that works. Before Lexapro I was on Prozac, but due to some trauma they switched me to lexapro in order to manage some depression I started to suffer from. Prozac wasn‚Äôt terrible, but lexapro did help me a loooooot better. I‚Äôm just frustrated it only lasted just over a year. 
I will say I have not been a fan of the side effects I garnered from Lexapro. Mostly extreme fatigue as well as excessive sweating. I have a doctor appointment on Monday, so I will talk to my primary about all of this at that time. 
Any suggestions? What was your experience with Lexapro? What medication worked best for you? I‚Äôm just feeling quite lost and hopeless atm. I‚Äôm so disheartened as I feel I need to start over again.
Thank you if you read this far btw ü§ç",56
Lexapro taking too long to help,A year ago or more my drs took me off my medication. I was on Lexapro for years. I thought I was ok but obviously I wasn‚Äôt. I was falling down a steep hill. I had a breakdown and ended up getting my meds again. But it has been a couple weeks and although I was starting to feel better this AM I woke up in a full on panic attack and feeling extremely depressed like can‚Äôt get out of bed depressed. I‚Äôm really scared this won‚Äôt go away. What if nothing I do makes it better? I can‚Äôt even work right now. I am desperate for this feeling to go away. üò≠,57
Lexapro effects and side-effects,"I didn't think that there were any side-effects, but now that I've been slowly weening myself off, I'm realizing the side-effects.

Positive effects of Lexapro:

* Less irritability
* Less anxiety
* Less hopelessness

Side-effects of Lexapro:

* Mind is not as sharp. Solving puzzles is much easier when you're not on Lexapro. If you're an engineer, and you are doing technical interviews, Lexapro will significantly reduce you ability to solve puzzles.
* You can't cry. I would be sad. I would want to cry, but the best I could do was make sad faces and say ""boo hoo hoo"". It was really weird. I've slowly weened myself off - skip a day, skip two days, 3 days, and haven't taken it in a week now. I cried today just listening to a song. It felt good.

Now that I'm weening myself off of Lexapro, I find myself getting more irritated when my dog stops to smell something, usually like a millions times on our walks. People are irritating me again. But I'm going to stay off of it either indefinitely or at least until I find a job. It was really screwing up my tech interviews. I was having trouble with eazy problems on leetcode, now I'm flying through medium problems.",58
Lexapro isn't helping ,"Idk I've been on Lexapro for over 5 years at 20mg. It helps kinda , but I'm still suicid@l AF.

Idk I feel like there's no hope that I will ever get better. I want to get better but my DBT therapist hasn't been responding. I barely even see her because I can't afford it.

Lexapro after 1 day.. should I stop? ,"I started taking lexapro last night and I hate it. I got prescribed for it for depression and anxiety although it‚Äôs mild.

"Lexapro, Wellbutrin, viibryd","
I started taking Lexapro at 10 mlg over a year ago. It gave me a bit of reprieve from anxiety and uplifted my mood. I did not have such intense mood flips throughout the day and overall was a positive. It did affect my libido however which in turn was affecting my relationship so a month ago my psychiatrist prescribed Wellbutrin. The past month has been rough. My anxiety peaked through the roof. Ive felt extremely irritable, almost rage at the slightest thing. My mood shifts throughout the day have been akin to when I‚Äôm not on meds and in general I‚Äôve felt much more emotionally sensitive. My psychiatrist suggested I try viibryd, as it‚Äôs similar to Lexapro with a much lower risk of libido side affects.
The crazy thing is even though Wellbutrin has made me feel awful the majority of the month the extra energy it gives me and the level of focus/clarity makes me not want to put it down. I‚Äôm realizing that Lexapro may of been making me feel slightly numb. I feel like I‚Äôm feeling again. This past week of taking it has been a bit better, but the added anxiety and irritation is still present. I don‚Äôt know much about viibryd. The process of medication change is exhausting and I‚Äôm hesitant to try it. 
Has anyone had similar experiences to above meds? What are your thoughts on viibryd? Thanks. ",61
Lexapro severely reduced my metabolism,"Hey guys, I just had a question, so Ive been on lexapro for like 11 months and just got off of it(its been two weeks). As soon as I got on it, I gained weight, and my metabolism decreased by almost half. I am an intense athlete and used to eat 3300 calories a day, and now I can only eat 1800, and if I eat anything more I gain weight. Its depressing, I have no energy throughout the day, cant eat food like I used to, cant go outside and eat with friends, and have to be so restrictive to not be fat. 

its been two weeks off of it and there are no improvements in my metabolism, am I screwed? Will this improve and will I get back to normal? My doctor said it can take time, and that there is nothing wrong with my blood work.  Im scared my life just got ruined for a very long time. ",62
Lexapro - change in dose,"Hi, I have been taking Lexapro daily for almost 11 months. After a relapse and a period of particularly bad depression (low self-esteem, anxiety, negative spiralling thoughts, weight loss), it was increased in November. The same again around a month ago. I am now on 20mg a day, which I take every morning. A blood test determined that the levels were quite low, which is why it was increased a month ago. I am still experiencing bad symptoms and think it might be time to try another antidepressant. I know many of you will have similar experiences with medication and I wish to get some advice before I go back to the psychiatrist. I also visit a therapist every week.

Anyone take lexapro and Buspar? ,"On week 3.

I don‚Äôt know if what I‚Äôm feeling is increased anxiety, but I definitely feel more‚Ä¶irritable, triggered by my past trauma (hurt, angry, confused.) which is the reason I started therapy‚Ä¶and started medication to help me maximize therapy.

How did you overcome medication withdrawal (Lexapro)?,"Ever since starting Lexapro I‚Äôve gained about 50lbs. It‚Äôs destroying my confidence.

Recently, I‚Äôve dropped from 20mg to 10mg and I take them every other day (when I feel brain zaps, cloudy mind). Has anyone quit cold turkey ? If so, how long will the withdrawals last? I use CBD to help combat most of the withdraw symptoms but it‚Äôs difficult sometimes still.

"Buspirone, lexapro and lorazepam","A few weeks ago I got hit by a few misfortunes at once and developed some issues. I haven‚Äôt slept much in weeks, and I feel like I constantly have a panic attack.

I was given buspirone by a nurse practitioner that I was able to see - 7.5mg twice a day.

In addition to this I have something called ‚Äúbromazepam‚Äù I was prescribed this abroad to take as needed and I didn‚Äôt take it so I have a few. I think it‚Äôs similar to lorazepam. 

Buspirone doesn‚Äôt feel like it helped at all and it‚Äôs been perhaps four weeks. The bromazepam pills I break in half so I take 1.5mg twice a day. This seems to help ever so slightly.

I will see a psychiatrist finally in about a week. In the meantime I was able to schedule an appointment with another nurse practitioner and she prescribed me escitalopram after I said that I was taking that before. However she asked me what‚Äôs the dosage as if I were the doctor. She ended up prescribing 10mg but I think I started with five many years ago. 

It‚Äôs been a few days side I got it and I haven‚Äôt taken it. With a week left to go to see a proper doctor I‚Äôm kinda afraid, but also, I‚Äôm not doing great and would take anything that could help. Should I start with half a dose of escitalopram? Please advise.",66

Just took both for the first time about 2 and a half hours ago but am now kind of freaking out because in trying to educate myself a bit on each drug I found out that they are advised to not be taken together due to serotonin syndrome risk. I know I have a tendency to be kind of a hypochondriac but now I‚Äôm getting kind of anxious and can‚Äôt tell if I have symptoms or not. If anyone has any advice or knows that I did something wrong that I should know about (like taking both for the first time at the same time) please lmk.

Edit: the other thing that I didn‚Äôt mention was that I‚Äôm a daily weed smoker, I asked my dr before hand if I should quit and he said to try to taper down but not to worry about going cold turkey or anything, so I smoked a bit tn assuming it would be better to not have to suddenly adjust to no weed and new meds at the same time.

Struggling with Lexapro and Seeking Support,"Hello! Back in 2019, I started with Zoloft but faced challenges when my doctor advised stopping. Last December, I went off antidepressants, initially feeling good but later had to admit myself to a mental hospital due to a sucide atempt. I've been on Lexapro for the past two months, started seeing a psychologist, but unfortunately, these last few weeks have been particularly challenging.

Despite having friends, I feel a lonely, and it seems like no one truly understands what I'm going through. No body seems like they want to truly help me but are more dug up in their already established points. The world feels lonely isolating. I'm also coping with the stress of a past relationship that ended without closure. I am really desperate, and suicidal thoughs are back on my mind and it's taking a toll on me.

I have an upcoming appointment with my psychiatrist in two months and I can't do it earlier. My psychologist appointments are more frequent, ever 3 weeks but I'm struggling to find the support I need, since I don't really feel like I ""clicked"" with the psychologist. I can't find others since this is the only one paid by the state.

I am also unemployed, it adds another layer of stress, especially in my financially challenging situation. I am searching actively for jobs and I hope I will find something soon. I do not live in the west so that complicates things a bit.

I am asking for any advice, shared experiences, or any support you can offer. It's a tough journey, but I'm determined not to give up. Thanks for reading, it means a lot.",73
Lexapro// possible Bipolar TW,"So I‚Äôve been dealing with mental health issues for a very long time. I‚Äôm an ex-cutter, have been to therapy for borderline personality disorder. OCD, GAD and PTSD are other diagnosis‚Äôs I have. And it‚Äôs been suspected I may have bipolar.

I hadn‚Äôt been on medication since 2019, but this winter I sunk in to a very deep and scary depressive episode that led me to seek medical help. The doctor gave me a referral to reconnect with my psychologist. And a script for 10mg Lexapro. I booked the appointment for 3 wks in advance with my psych, and started taking Lexapro that day. 

For the first week, I was a superhero. Absolutely flying. I wrote and produced 3 songs from scratch and they were possibly the best songs I‚Äôve ever written. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I was wired. I was on my Instagram story boasting about the music that‚Äôs to come, when normally I‚Äôm quite humble. 
I had a photoshoot and was super comfortable in front of the camera, which is not normal for me. 

I felt the intensity start to wear off and then for the next 2-3 weeks I was drawing. Obsessively. Now I‚Äôm not normally very good at drawing, but the stuff I was turning out was phenomenal. I literally could not put the pen down, to the point where the skin started peeling on one of my fingers and I have calluses on my thumb. 

I saw my psychologist and she encouraged me to see a psychiatrist as she believes this was a reaction typical of Bipolar patients. 

So I went back to the doctor and have got a referral for psychiatrist. The doctor refilled my script.

For this past week I‚Äôve been taking the Lexapro as normal, but I don‚Äôt feel manic/creative/wired anymore. I feel completely apathetic. I work from home and pick my own hours and I haven‚Äôt been able to find the motivation to do any work. It‚Äôs hard to get out of bed and do simple things like wash the dishes. I wouldn‚Äôt say im depressed any more. Im just flat. Like an empty shell. With very little emotions or care for anything. 

I have thoughts of things I‚Äôd like to do, like write a song and update my resume, but the drive to do so is not there. Im pretty much couch locked binge watching true crime and playing games on my phone. 

I think I should stop taking Lexapro and will be seeing my doctor today so she can help me taper off slowly. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone with bipolar has had a similar reaction to Lexapro or other SSRI‚Äôs. Cheers",74

prozac or lexapro? feeling confused,"I got out of hospital last week due to a severe depressive episode. Because i felt like I had to have a goal in mind, not just to stay safe, I had the doc switch me back to Lexapro. I've been on Lex before, it worked quite well...until it didn't anymore. So then I went back on prozac after Lex quit working a few months ago. I figured if I switched back to Lexapro this time around i would respond again.
Now, I'm confused. Lex worked really well for my GAD but didn't really touch depression. Prozac helps me focus a bit more and is less subduing. I am also augmenting with Welbutrin 100mg SR. I see my psychiatrist tomorrow and she's not aware of the hospital stay because I didn't sign a roi so I'll have to tell her about it myself. The thing is, I'm confused as to which one I should take now. I have both here because the Lex got filled at the chemist from hospital, not my normal chemist. So that chemist still thinks I'm on Prozac.
I took the Lex all week last week then switched back to Prozac this morning to compare, and to be honest I don't feel much of a change. So now I'm very confused.

Things in my life were looking up but I found currently in the last week I've had major anxiety and may have started falling into old habits. I know that it can take some time for these kinds of medications to level out has anybody else dealt with this downfall before. I'm really hoping that this doesn't mean I need to try a different kind of medication because I was having such a great experience with this 1. Thank you all for any of the help that you can give me.",82

Nightmare Disorder Advice & Treatment Experiences?,"I haven't had restful sleep in 7 years due to incredibly vivid & intense dreams/nightmares that occur every night, multiple times a night (assumed to be a lasting side effect of a trial of Cipralex). I wake up more exhausted each morning; it‚Äôs as if a part of me hasn‚Äôt shut off‚Ä¶like it‚Äôs being forced to watch high anxiety/morbid scenes each night without getting rest/turning off. I don‚Äôt have recurring dreams (although the themes are constant...suffocation/drowning/anxiety/panic/shame > classic nightmares) or any ‚Äòbig T‚Äô traumas but suffer from quiet borderline personality disorder, depression & OCPD.

I've tried keeping a good sleep hygiene routine, melatonin, tryptophan, magnesium, CBD/CBN, dream water, sleeping pills, prazosin, triazolam etc. with no positive change. THC (semi-helpful) has heavily caused dissociation/brain fog, lack of clarity/focus & extreme lethargy.

The consistent lack of restful sleep is destroying me‚Ä¶any advice/relatable experiences would be SOO APPRECIATED.

P.S. Nabilone & Topiramate have been recommended to trial & I‚Äôm also curious about the potential of EMDR & Image Rehearsal Therapy given I don‚Äôt have recurring dreams.",85
My clonazepam was increased now for ptsd,"I was diagnosed this summer with BPD, PTSD, GAD, and Depression. Basically my brother told me he wants to kill his ex recently and it triggered my anxiety rlly bad. He was admitted and is on meds now and has been released. 

My sister died by suicide last fall and my grandma died in the spring. She was a drug user and violent offender so I fear my brother will repeat the cycle. My mom died 4 years ago. I have 3 kids. I feel like I'm drowning some days but the med has been helping.

Constant headache and dizziness while leaving antidepressant. Normal?,"Hi guys, is there anyone who recently started to leave antidepressants?  
I have been using 20 mg of Cipralex (also known as Lexapro?) daily, for more than a year. We agreed with my psychotherapist I could start coming off. I was supposed to reduce the dose with 5 mg weekly.  Since I started to reduce, I have had a constant headache, some days it is not that bad sometimes it is worse. After 4 or 5 days I went to a neurologist, she examined me, took MRI, but they didn't find anything unusual. After 4 weeks I still have the headache and since yesterday I am feeling serious dizziness.  Is it possible there is any relation between the reduced dose ( I am on zero since yesterday) and these symptoms or this is more likely caused by the weather or something else? 

Thank you very much for any help! (I would like to avoid to talk to my doctor if possible).

Mental health at breaking point,"All I do is stare at walls and cry... I failed out of my university's computer science program, switched out to a different major (unrelated) and graduated last year. These were the worst 5.5 years of my life and I still think about failing first year CS everyday. Mainly because I never told my parents about my switch to a different major because they would be disapproving of my choice of major, and I'm absolutely terrified of them. Secondly because I still cannot manage to stomach this failure (has become really hard to get into grad school).

I work as a software engineer now, and I can't even get through my days anymore. Constantly crying, procrastinating, researching undergrad programs, taking 10 mg melatonin supplements to fall asleep. I was out on anxiety meds in the past and they made it really hard to think (cipralex). 

I really don't know what to do at this point, I cry randomly, spiral out of control, have lost most of my motivation, and my boss has started to take a note of my lowered performance in the past 3-5 months.

Is my medication not working?,"Hey all,
I was prescribed cipralex after a very painful breakup. I started taking it a month ago but I don‚Äôt feel my symptoms improving. I‚Äôm constantly thinking about the ex and his new gf, and the rumination is happening non-stop. The thoughts, images and memories are playing in my head on loop at all times. I have little appetite and have lost 15 lbs already. My school work has really suffered as I can‚Äôt get anything done.

I‚Äôm constantly on the verge of tears and have days of uncontrollable crying. 
I was on a low dose of the medication (10mg) which the doctor increased to 15mg yesterday.

Is this normal to be feeling the same after a month of antidepressants? How do you feel when the medication is working?

is it the depression or the antidepressant that is making me not interested in anything in life?,"yeah just like the title, i have been on cipralex (lexapro) for more than 5 months bc of loved one+friendship breakups and i don‚Äôt have interest to do absolutely anything, not my hobbies, not my studies/future job (which is graphic design, and it needs creativity which is completely lost), not even interested to eve try new food at a good restaurant when my sister, ask me, actually not even interest to watch any movie or get off bed.

Hey, I'm 18 
Have adhd
I Have depression, and obesity due to 
emotional eating over the years

Reacntly my panic attacks came back (about 3 months ago), with the feeling of disconnected from Realty, also at the same time I had to switch a doctor, at this time I was on sertraline (Serenada) the doctor told me we should switch the medicine to Escitalopram (Cipralex) and I thought everything will be decent again, after only 4 days i switched to the new medicine (now the i think about it, maybe it was too fast, but thats what he told me) anyway  I was so wrong about everything becoming decent again, the first month was a NIGHTMARE I has insane panic attacks, insane anxiety, I felt so disconnected from Realty, bunch of random thoughts in my head, one time I will not forget this, I had the most insane panic attack I ever had, I felt so disconnected, so dizzy, my vision went blurry, and since that day stuff has becoming wrost, sometimes  I had days when I just keep questing Realty, I thought I was dead, and really believed it, I thought I was in a difference universe, all kind of really weird stuff, sometimes I think I'm schizophrenic. Anyways
after visiting the doctor again, and telling him everything, he said I should keep taking it just add more (5mg-10mg-15-20mg) my parents kept supporting me and help me going through this, but the moment I start taking 20mg, I just coldeve keep going, it was just suffering, now I'm lowering this medicine, buy I still have a lot of problems I would like to share,
I feel like my brain is not working,
I Feel dizzy and ""flying"",
Sometimes when trying to go to sleep I'm feeling like I'm going to die, and just don't feel reality for a second,

My memory is also very bad lately 
I'm trying to keep going to doctors and sharing with my family  the stuff I'm going through.

Switching from sertraline to fluoxetine,"Hi I‚Äôve been on sertraline for about 4 months for my OCD, and my OCD has become a lot easier to deal with but I began to feel quite depressed and numb. I spoke to my doctor about this around two weeks ago and they suggested upping my dosage to 75mg after being on 50. 

The past two weeks I‚Äôve experienced the same feeling of numbness and being depressed along side having chills and feverish symptoms at times. I noticed I have become unhappy most of the time. Today I spoke to my doctor and he recommended fluoxetine. Has anyone experienced this transition and was it an easy process?

Fluoxetine made me genuinely happy (Sorry long) ,"Hi, I don't really know who else to tell this to other than my boyfriend but I really feel like I want to tell people because I am so happy.

I have been depressed for around 12 years. I grew up with depression because I had a rough childhood with conflicts, deaths and economical struggles. Everything started to grow dull after the age of 6. I pretended to be someone else, felt anxious, insecure, depressed and hopeless. I never let myself be happy because I figured that it would just make me more vulnerable to hardships, I've barely ever felt any emotions ever and used to always pretend and act infront of other people to not seem rude or ungrateful. 
 I watched other people's reactions to different things and learned how to act in different situations.

I didn't even know this was unusual till about half a year ago when I met my now boyfriend. We talked about mental health one night and he helped me realize that I wasn't okay. I started doing more therapy and began eating fluoxetine and my bf encouraged me through it all and always stayed by my side and supported me through the roughest things I've gone through mentally.

 I am very sensitive to drugs used to treat mental health issues and react highly with usually the worst side effects. I started eating fluoxetine and the beginning was rough, everything got worse but in a way felt better. I can't explain it. I could suddenly for around 30 minutes feel intense emotions I've never felt before and I felt in a way more stable even though my suicidal thoughts and anxiety was worse. I think it maybe was because I had started to feel instead of blocking everything subconsciously. My doctor knew I was highly sensitive and tried to get me off the meds but we ended up getting into an argument. I wanted to keep eating the medicine since I felt it helped me and I felt good at times in ways I've never felt good, those times became more often the more time passed. Eventually we compromised that I would stop eating the medicine in a month if it still was the same. 

I know that it usually indicates that a medicine is not for you if you have bad side effects continuously. But my doctor wanted me to quit after two weeks when I had side effects, the medicine usually worsens symptoms in the beginning so I am not sure why she seemed so surprised.  

 I know I am reactive to medicine and this time I felt something positive from it in the beginning at times, this hasn't happened before when I have eaten other medications.

 I don't really trust her judgement enough sadly since she often has made false claims, given false information, caused many unnecessary arguments, is pushy and acts hostile towards patients.

I've eaten the medicine now for around 4-5 months. I have since doubled it to 20mg instead of 10mg everyday,  it was low but we wanted to start slowly since I am so reactive. I felt the best benefits when I started eating 20mg even though I reacted a bit in the beginning again but it passed fairly quickly. The worst part has passed in around 2+ months ago. It felt like years and it was terrible, close and accidental attempted suicide, but I made it through thanks to the support of my partner and my mother.  

Nowadays I feel more genuinely happy, stable, my mind is quiet and clear, I can think, I have started doing hobbies again, I pay attention to my loved ones, I see a future, I look forward to every day and what it has to offer me, I see beauty in everything.This is things I don't remember feeling in my entire life and it feels like I am experiencing life for the first time. I love to experience feelings genuinely, it feels great even though it was a bit overwhelming sometimes in the start and I am still getting used to it.

Of course, I still have some way to go but I feel like my suffering is soon completely over. I feel like I finally have finished coping and grieving after many years. 

I am writing this to also perhaps bring hope to other people suffering. I thought that I wouldn't become better and that this was just who I was. That was just the depression that had it's effect over me. You can break free but it will be tough. But you will feel so much better in the end and it will be so worth it.

If someone read this far thank you a lot :)! If you want someone to talk to or have any questions or anything about depression or medicarions, you can DM and ask me, would be happy to chat.

60mg Fluoxetine for GAD,,98
Has anyone had any similar experiences with Fluoxetine?,"I've been on fluoxetine for 13 days now and I have to say it has really changed me for the better.
I feel normal and energized, I no longer have brain fog and I can actually focus and do things. 
I've always been a very low energy person to the point I felt like a zombie at times and the smallest task was very hard for me to do, but when I started taking fluoxetine it changed.
However, 2 days in I can feel like all the energy and motivation this medicine gave me is toning down, I'm slowly starting to feel the same tiredness and brain fog again and I'm afraid I will start feeling the same again soon. I was so happy I was finally getting to feel normal and could walk without getting dizzy all the time.
Anybody has any similar experiences? Does it actually get the same or worse again? Or is this just a period that will pass?",99
Psychiatrists: can I take 300mg of bupropion with 20mg of fluoxetine? (Self-Medication) ,"I have a low energy problem, then my new psychiatrist changed my medication. I've changed my medication a lot of times on the last 2 years with my old psychiatrist, due to this low energy problem, and nothing helps me. Except for the Bupropion. When I told to my new psychiatrist this, she increased the Bupropion to 300mg, and she told me to stop Venlafaxine. So did I. However, now I remembered I haven't told her about my OCD. I emailed her, and she reduced again the Bupropion to 150mg and gave me Fluoxetine 20mg. I didn't liked that AT ALL. I'm so tired of this low energy, 2 years living with this, I swear to God. I told her ""isn't that keep the problem I have now?"" But she insisted on the 150mg Bupropion. So I'm thinking about doing something really stupid but which I think it's the only option: self-medication. I want to keep the Bupropion 300mg and to start Fluoxetine 20mg. I'm just afraid It's something which isn't safe. I need to ask psychiatrists first, before doing it by myself, so I'm asking here. Help",100

Advice on taking fluoxetine (prozac),"TL;DR at the end. I've had severe anxiety and on-and-off depression for about 11 years now. A couple months ago, I finally decided to try medication and my psychiatrist and I decided to try ritalin first. This is because I suspected I may have ADHD (my brother was recently diagnosed) and taking ritalin had low stakes (fewer side effects than depression meds, doesn't build up in the system, etc).

At first, the ritalin worked well, but on week two my anxiety went through the *roof*. I was irritable, I was spiraling over little things. And when I was angry and snapping at people, my social anxiety made me obsessively replay those moments over and over. I felt horrible.

I eventually stopped taking ritalin because it was interacting so poorly with my anxiety and decided to try fluoxetine.

I found a lot of stories here of people saying they had panic attacks or that fluoxetine made their anxiety worse, but they kept taking it and eventually the medication helped them. My question is: should I do the same? If my anxiety flares and I feel out of control, is it something I should push through? I've never taken a medication that relies on building up in your system so I really want to know the consequences of quitting early or the benefits of continuing to take it while my body gets used to it.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I quit ritalin in the past because it made my anxiety worse. Now that I'm starting fluoxetine, if my anxiety gets bad should I push through and keep taking it every day, or should I quit? How do I know if the medication is right for me?",104

fluoxetine Vs paroxetine PTSD?,"Hello, 
I was wondering if anyone has any experiences of taking both of these and which one helped more for PTSD?

As background:
*I have depression, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD and general anxiety. (A lovely mix of childhood and adult trauma)
* In the past I've been on Sertraline/Zoloft, escitalopram, amitriptyline, trazodone, duloxetine/cymbalta, and fluoxetine. 

*Out of them all fluoxetine has been the only one that was good enough for my mood with minimal enough side effects and I've been on it three years. I came off it at the start of this year to see what I was like and maybe try new meds for pain issues. (In the interim I was put on duloxetine for vulvodyina, worst med I've ever been on and I've come off it). My Dr has told me he will put me back on fluoxetine because of how bad 

I am but I'm just looking into meds specifically proven for PTSD and paroxetine sounds better? I'm not sure. I'm in a rock and a hard place cos on one side I want to feel better, and on another side I'm supposed to be getting married in July and I don't want to make myself worse trying another med?

Prozac (fluoxetine) is giving me panic attacks what should i do?,"(This is my first reddit post)

I (18m) have been taking fluoxetine for the past 2 months. Note that i often forget to take doses every now and then. I have read about side effects including heightened anxiety and frequent panic attacks.

Some context about my situation. 
I had not noticed any of these side effects until after I greened out recently. After the bad trip i have experienced several panic attacks and derealisation. The bad trip made me question my perception of reality. The panic attacks are often related to this. The panic attacks consist of an impending sense of doom making me feel like im dying. Time feels like its slowed and I'm trapped inside my own mind. Everything feels like its floating away.

I suspect that these symptoms  are due to fluoxetine however i want to know if anyone else has experienced something similar and if i should be concerned or if the derealisation and frequent panic attacks are normal?",110

Day 5 10mg Prozac,"Day 5 of 10mg Prozac. I‚Äôve been pairing my take as needed .5mg Clonazepam with my morning dose of Prozac, then taking another .5 Clonazepam before bed. 

2 months ago, i was on Lexapro 10mg and miserable. Took it for 3 months. I was throwing up every morning, I was anxious, I felt a sense of impending doom all the time, i was a ticking time bomb and everything n everything could set me off. 

5 days in on Prozac and i feel so great that it feels like it‚Äôs placebo (if it is, keep it going!). On day 2 i woke up at 10AM with energy (rare for me) and i went to the driving range by 11!

SSRI(Prozac) and libido struggles,"22yr old Male I have been on Prozac for about 4-5 years since high school 2019. I took it for anxiety/panic attacks and depression. I started on 20mg. I didn‚Äôt have libido issues at first. Fall of 2021 struggling with more anxiety and depression I began taking 40mg of Prozac. After the new years fresh into 2022 I noticed a frantic shift in my libido and erectile dysfunction. Ever since it has been a nightmare. I have had to take viagra which keep in mind only works if your in the mood. So my low libido wasn‚Äôt super effective with viagra. I then became more anxious and depressed. I am now at the point that have no sexual confidence  as a result of my low libido and ED. It is now not only a medicine issue but also mentally now I lack any sexual confidence. I then attempted to lower my Prozac dose but I was had too much anxiety and hopped back on. Then I decided to add 100mg of Wellbutrin with the 40mg of Prozac as my psychiatrist believed that would be the fix to my low libido. Unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt so I was determined to get my libido back so I lowered Prozac again to 20mg have been fighting through the tough adjustment of anxiety and depression levels. Now I‚Äôm on 20mg of Prozac and 100mg of Wellbutrin(on for 5 months now)‚Ä¶ and still not libido change.

My doctor put me on wellbutrin 150mg XL about 6 weeks ago and I feel great. Getting stuff done, energy etc. But I have been ‚Äúsnippy‚Äù. I feel bitchy towards certain people.  I have heard great things about the Prozac and Wellbutrin combo.  Prozac did work for my bitchiness, I was a nice person then. I like the getting stuff done feeling now and having energy.

Prozac symptoms?,"I've brought it up to my psychiatrist a while and I will be doing it again next appointment, but I noticed a symptom that could've only come with the Prozac, I can't see any other reason.
I've never been someone that can handle heat or humidity but after being put on Prozac I feel like I'm a volcano inside and out and my god the sweating. I didn't have a sweating issue before, but now I look soaked even if I'm not doing anything. I do notice it's insufferable when my body is preparing for period time but  it's not much better outside of that. I can't even exercise anymore because between my OCD disgust of sweat and the immediate overheating at any basic exertion I'm beginning to gain weight that I'm not comfortable with. Has anyone else had anything similar or maybe could advice a better way for me to explain it so I'm actually heard and miserable it makes me. Meds are not really easy to mess with for me so I get it but I'd like her to hear me out and see if there is some way to elevate the issue.",120

Tinnitus from prozac for 4 days,"Hey I took prozac for 4 days 20mg and I'm pretty sure it caused me permanent tinnitus. I should have known it was ototoxic and I feel so much regret for taking it, how something like that small, 4 days, can affect my whole life. Who knows what it might have done that I can't see. But I feel this is so difficult to live with this tinnitus when I could have been healthy and fine if I had not made that decision. I wanted to believe the drugs were helpful and I was being silly for being afraid of them, but the tinnitus is undeniable damage if it was from the drug. :( \*Sigh\* I had been around that whole year, 2 years, and I was healthy but I didn't realize it, now I have tinnitus.

Weight gain on prozac?,"I finally went to go and see someone and I got put on fluoxetine/prozac. I heard it can cause weight gain.

On January 4th my doctor decided to up me to 60mg. My anxiety from Dec 28 to Jan 12 was unbearable, but I woke up one day and felt a lot better.

I never seeked mental help until last year as it got to a point i cant take it anymore

Last year i was on zoloft with another doctor who i kept telling her that its not working she kept upping the dose until i stopped going and stopped it cold turkey

prozac or lexapro? feeling confused,"I got out of hospital last week due to a severe depressive episode. Because i felt like I had to have a goal in mind, not just to stay safe, I had the doc switch me back to Lexapro. I've been on Lex before, it worked quite well...until it didn't anymore. So then I went back on prozac after Lex quit working a few months ago. I figured if I switched back to Lexapro this time around i would respond again.
Now, I'm confused. Lex worked really well for my GAD but didn't really touch depression. Prozac helps me focus a bit more and is less subduing. I am also augmenting with Welbutrin 100mg SR. I see my psychiatrist tomorrow and she's not aware of the hospital stay because I didn't sign a roi so I'll have to tell her about it myself. The thing is, I'm confused as to which one I should take now. I have both here because the Lex got filled at the chemist from hospital, not my normal chemist. So that chemist still thinks I'm on Prozac.
I took the Lex all week last week then switched back to Prozac this morning to compare, and to be honest I don't feel much of a change. So now I'm very confused.
Any thoughts? if any of you guys are on Lex/welbutrin or prozac/welbutrin combo give me your input as to how the different combinations effect you.

Prozac has changed my life.,"Hey everyone I've posted on here a few times on and off over the past year or so. I've gotten a lot of great advice and encouragement throughout the past year. I recently expressed my feeling to a close family member and they helped me get in contact with my doctor to prescribe me some medication. In the past I've taken Seroquel but it destroyed my motivation in school and sex life with my girlfriend. I was prescribed Prozac instead and over the past 2 or 3 months my mental health has never been better.

I'm not a zombie like how I was on Seroquel and I can still feel normal emotions just within reason given the circumstance. I used to lose my shit over the smallest things like my dog pooping in the house or something and I'd ball my eyes out over the slightest stresses. I want to encourage any of you who maybe going through something similar to get into contact with your doctor and ask about Prozac if you haven't already. 

P.S. No I'm not a drug rep or anything just some 24 year old dickhead hoping my experience can help someone.",137

Bromazepam + paroxetine + aripiprazole help/info,"Hi, I M26 suffer from major resistant depression and agoraphobia. For the past two years I took bromazepam at occurance (max 3mg a day) and for the past 8 months I took paroxetine (40mg daily).

Now my psychiatrist wants me to take an ekg to then start taking aripiprazole (starting with low dosage, can't remember how much rn). I don't know much about meds and stuff but I trust them. This time though I've read that this last medication is used in schizophrenic patients and could cause/augment adhd symptoms. Should I be worried? Does any of you tried this combination? How it felt?

I‚Äôve previously taken paroxetine for 4 years 20mg no dramas or side effects very effective for my anxiety and I would like to go back on it. 

My question is: can I stop taking Effexor today and commence the paroxetine tomorrow?

My bloods and ecg all normal. Also I‚Äôm on the lowest dose possible of the Effexor. 

If I start the paroxetine tomorrow is there any risk of serotonin syndrome? Considering they are such small dosages. 

Because yeh psychiatrist booked out for 2 months and GP was clueless.

fluoxetine Vs paroxetine PTSD?,"Hello, 
I was wondering if anyone has any experiences of taking both of these and which one helped more for PTSD?

As background:
*I have depression, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD and general anxiety. (A lovely mix of childhood and adult trauma)
* In the past I've been on Sertraline/Zoloft, escitalopram, amitriptyline, trazodone, duloxetine/cymbalta, and fluoxetine. 

*Out of them all fluoxetine has been the only one that was good enough for my mood with minimal enough side effects and I've been on it three years. I came off it at the start of this year to see what I was like and maybe try new meds for pain issues. (In the interim I was put on duloxetine for vulvodyina, worst med I've ever been on and I've come off it). My Dr has told me he will put me back on fluoxetine because of how bad 

I am but I'm just looking into meds specifically proven for PTSD and paroxetine sounds better? I'm not sure. I'm in a rock and a hard place cos on one side I want to feel better, and on another side I'm supposed to be getting married in July and I don't want to make myself worse trying another med? But like why start fluoxetine again to then come off it again to maybe try paroxetine afterwards?

 Anyway I can't find any direct studies comparing the two and thought yous may have some experiences/knowledge of if they're chemically similar etc?",145

Went manic on half a Paroxetine 5 days into cannabis withdrawal oh god,"Has anyone heard of this happening before ? I took half a paroxetine and had a manic episode. I thought I was on the up and up and I'd beat any addiction. Running around the house loving my music and my friend came in and saw me and freaked out because I was as red as a beetroot and really HIGH. I stopped all THC products about 5 days ago and haven't been well at all with CHS type symptoms. I believe my friend because his brother has had mania and psychosis resulting in hospital admission because of it. 

Could it be something to do with the residual THC interacting with the anti depressant ? I'm not sure what this means or what to do because I have a substance abuse disorder and I really loved the feeling I got and probably still have. I thought it took 2 weeks or more for anti depressants to work and I've tried this one before a very long time ago and didn't have any symptoms like this. In fact I stopped because it made me feel emotionless. 

I'm a bit afraid of wanting to take more of it. Only a bit because a big part of me really liked it.",147
HOW I KILLED MOST OF MY ANXIETY with CBT and Paroxetine BUT STILL NEED HELP! Any psychiatrist out there?,"I ""HAD"" severe anxiety issues. Growing up my parents were particularly abusive. They had black and white thinking often shutting down my opinions if they contradicted their own. They would often yell at me, be hyper critical if I made a mistake, and gaslighting me. I was never physically hit but it always came close. The threat was there. I ran away from home 3x's. **Back then my anxiety/depression was at a constant 10/10 in 2014, spiking to 12 to 15/10 under various circumstances.**

**However**, through sheer grit and determination I applied CBT on myself in college in NYC. I constantly went out and talked to people and put myself in uncomfortable situations -- often getting rejected. I learned social cues and destroyed a lot of my preconceived notions about reality. I gained friends and had 2 girlfriends in the course of 4 years. **My anxiety was still at a constant 6/10, sometimes spiking to 8/10.** 

My studies suffered because I still experienced MASSIVE anxiety in my everyday life. I still couldn't sit down, focus, and read/write. The same things that scared me in the past still do but to a lesser degree. 

Fast Forward after a couple months trying to meditate and deal with things organically **I was given paroxetine 25 mg by my psychiatrist.**  It has changed my life, helping me focus on my job as a Software Engineer, form better relationships with friends and parents\*. **My anxiety is at constant 0/10**. **Sometimes spiking to a 2-3/10**. I'm a normal fukkin person now. 

**HOWEVER** sometimes I experience periods of extreme anxiety bursting to an 6-8/10. I used to smoke a lot of **weed**. Like A LOT to curb my anxiety. I stopped 100% 1.5 yearS ago **BUT I still experience a placebo high when I smell it.** I feel slightly high even though I know I am not physically affected by THC. I think my serotonin levels temporarily increase. Then drop after not leaving my apartment and smelling weed. **That's when my anxiety boosts to a constant 4/10, spiking to a 6/10** and a lot of my fears and issues start bubbling back up. It's really damn uncomfortable.

"Got put on risperidone and paroxetine, got terrible side effects. Psychiatrist told me to continue, too scared. What should I do?","I got put on half dose of both risperidone and paroxetine for OCD. After 2 hours of taking paroxetine I started to feel dreamy, as if I was watching a movie of myself. I could still do my work but it was surreal. I took risperidone and went to bed, and woke up with a terrible headache, vomiting sensation, and complete emotional numbness as well as a complete detachment from myself. I freaked out but couldn't even feel fear/sadness, and then something funny happened and I couldn't even be happy. I legitimately thought I was out of my body and couldn't return into it. After reading the label (was told not to by my psychiatrist) I saw that there is a 1/1000 chance to get derealization on paroxetine which described perfectly what I had, and a 1/100 chance to get emotional numbness on risperidone.

I told my psychiatrist about it and she said that ""don't worry the vomiting sensation will subside and take the medication"" without even mentioning the other symptoms I told her about. I'm thinking of just going to therapy and not take this treatment, my family has a bad history with ssris and my grandma has been left with a certain ""dreaminess"" (she isn't like she used to be after 4 months of ssri treatment for addiction, she's way less present in the moment and reacts a bit slowly), and my mom also experienced derealisation after a smoking addiction treatment.

Panic Attack or Mild Serotonin Syndrome? Need Reassurance.,"Hey! 
I kinda need some reassurance from people that had experiences before!

So im taking 20mg of paroxetine daily and 5 days ago i took it a little later at 2pm. The day after i took it at 9am (so 5 hours earlier).

And now my head i going from 

>""i took it too early so it might have been too much""

to

>""Bro, 20mg is nothing you can literally take it before bed and take it again in the morning. shut up brain!""

and that made me so anxious that i have a panic attack for the last 4 days. Didnt take the meds for the last 4 days either cause i read mild SS would go away IF i had it. 

Early symptoms from SS are unfortunately the same as from a panic attack. So now im sitting here actually knowing that everything is fine but the symptoms are winning over.

So im not wrong with it being just my brain and a panic attack from the unknown, right?",157

Also, the doctor firstly put me on 2 tablets of Depakine (one before NIGHT) and it was fucking horrendous (only after cancelling the night pill i started feeling better), yet he still says that if i need to increase i need to take the second ¬º/¬Ω/1 tablet at least 6 hours after morning dose, and increasing it that way doesnt work for me. Why cant i just increase it in the morning instead?",158
Stopped taking my meds and feel fine ,"
As the title says, I've haven't taken my meds in a few months, I was on quetiapine and Paroxetine, I've had social anxiety, depression and psychosis which lasted a month.
I was also addicted to weed but I'm clean for a year now.
When I was prescribed my meds I definitely needed them, I was very psychotic and delusional, I was also smoking weed which didn't help.
But after some time being clean and having a better schedule I stopped taking my meds, not really by choise but slowly started skipping them and now I'm off them for a few months and generally feel better, at first it was hard being without the meds and I was lower energy and more depressed but I feel like things have settled.
I'm still afraid that my condition could worsen if something bad happened, I'm especially afraid that my psychosis will return.

Would like to hear opinions or similar stories if you guys stopped taking meds",159
Can upping my dose of Abilify from 5mg to 10mg help with my GAD and lack of motivation?,"So I am also taking 40mg of paroxetine and 20mg of buspirone but I still struggle with anxiety and depression... All I wanna do is sleep, be on my phone and I have zero motivation to do anything.

I feel so ashamed,I have severe sleep problems. Ever since I was a kid I've had trouble falling asleep at a normal hours and waking up during the morning. I've spoken about this to my psychiatrist when I was sent there bc of my OCD and I was prescribed trazodone for the sleep problem (I also take paroxetine for OCD and MDD). And it helped for a while. But I have a tendency of just making shit harder for myself and lately I've been fucking up and not taking my meds regularly. So once again my sleep schedule is fucked and today I just felt so exhausted that I just couldn't bring myself to go to uni. So now I feel so ashamed of myself for missing a lab class and now not studying for a quiz I have tomorrow but I just can't for the life of me focus on studying. All cuz I'm a stupid person who won't take their meds for some reason. The worst thing is I don't know why I'm not taking them. I just don't. If any of you have any advice on how to fix this issue I would be thankful,161
Can atypical anti-psychotics make you dumb? My case of cognitive decline,"I'm 22 years old and I started taking paroxetine 40mg and risperidone 3mg last year for my OCD. Before that I always had great concentration, focus, memory and comprehension abilities. 

Everything changed when I started those 2 medications and I suspect it's the risperidone that's causing it. I literally can't concentrate at all while studying, I've lost this whole year of college because of this. I feel dumb now and can't learn, is this a possible known side effect of risperidone or is it more likely to be caused by the paroxetine?",162
TRD and TROCD,"I have tried almost all the SSRIs and ADs including Paroxetine,Sertraline,Fluoxetine,Clomipramine,Fluvoxamine,Escitalopram and some APs including Olanzapine (Which i tried for a short period of time) and Risperidone (had to stop as it gave me really bad headache and my eyes were dripping tears) The only SSRI i haven‚Äôt tried is Citalopram. Can anyone of you guys give any advice on what i should do? I do visit a psychiatrist but i am considering to change it as he doesn‚Äôt seem helpful. I have heard great things about Aripiprazole in helping TRD combined with an SSRI.

Questions about Paxil withdrawal,"I‚Äôve recently started to come off of Paxil, I‚Äôve been taking 40mg for almost 10 years. While weaning off of Paxil I‚Äôve also started taking Bupropion. They have me taking 20mg of Paxil now to start slowly coming off of it and I‚Äôve noticed many symptoms since I‚Äôve begun this process such as nausea, brain zaps, anxiety, trouble sleeping, stomach problems and severe brain fog. I went to my pharmacist to ask about these and if Paxil could be the cause but I was told that I was being weaned off slow enough and with Bupropion that I shouldn‚Äôt experience any withdrawal symptoms and was told it was more than likely a result of my weight.
I feel utterly crazy, is this all in my head or due to my weight? Or is actually a thing that happens to other people coming off of Paxil?",164
Paxil Poop-Out?,"Hello!  I have been on Paxil for over two decades; I have had to increase dosage intermittently in the many years when my symptoms of anxiety returned; last time was in 2021 when I increased my dosage to 20mg, and added Bupronion HCI (150mg) as a secondary medication.  Normally Paxil works very well for me; but my symptoms of anxiety have returned in the past week.  My thoughts are to increase my Paxil to 30 or 40 mg to return to my non-anxious status.  Right now I feel quite fight-or-flight, and it is not very pleasant.  Overall I have no complaints about the quality of my life and stress levels; this runs in my family.

Trouble with internal tremors maybe related to paxil ,"Over the last 3 years I've experienced internal tremors and vibrations , been to multiple Dr and multiple tests with no good answers, these tremors come and go.

Paxil withdrawal?,So I‚Äôm a hypochondriac which makes it bad enough. I‚Äôm absolutely mortified of dying and I‚Äôve been taking Paxil to help me with this. Recently I ran out and I‚Äôve been desperately trying to find a psychiatrist and it‚Äôs hard. I‚Äôve been without it for about 4 days now. I feel the usual withdrawal symptoms and I just finally got a refill on my prescription. I did some research on Paxil withdrawal and I‚Äôm genuinely mortified. Everyone is saying it‚Äôs dangerous to go cold Turkey. I even read that someone picked up a guy who was having a seizure from his withdrawals. I don‚Äôt plan on quitting cold Turkey but even to taper off??? People are saying it‚Äôs horrible. I‚Äôm so so so afraid of dying as it is and I was never warned about this when I was initially put on Paxil. I‚Äôm angry and frustrated and scared.

"Serious medication interaction, but my doctor prescribed it??","So, I‚Äôve been on buspar and paxil for a while. Along with clonidine and Lamictal. Basically, your girl is a mess. 

I‚Äôve had to see multiple doctors recently regarding some physical health issues. And several of them have questioned the buspar, and paxil together and tell me it‚Äôs a bad idea. That is can cause serotonin syndrome and serious heart problems. 
But I‚Äôve been on them for years with more than one psych NP, and a psychiatrist as well, and no one has ever batted an eyelash. No pharmacist has ever questioned it either. 
I‚Äôve never had high blood pressure or anything suggesting a heart issue.
But I panicked and tried to get off the paxil. My doctor was a little surprised as to why, and I just tried to shrug it off. Say it was because of dry eyes and headaches, which turns out are unrelated.
And now, I‚Äôm an absolute mess. My anxiety and panic are a nightmare. I cry constantly.

TL;DR: Buspar and Paxil has worked well for me for years, but several regular (non-psych) doctors have raised concerns about the interactions. Tried to get off of paxil and now I‚Äôm a mess.

Schizoaffective Experience with Lamictal? still an option for me?,"Hi everyone! A very desperate call for advice. Suffering since 2016. 

I'm a 26 years old female.
I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder a couple of years ago. 

I never smoked or used alcohol/drugs 

Current medication:
Paroxetine (Paxil/Seroxat). 30 mg
Abilify: 10 mg
Wellbutrin: 150 mg (started 9 days ago)
All my blood levels (including thyroid) are normal only vitamin D deficiency (been checked numerous times) 

What's the problem and current situation:
Biggest problems 
--„ÄãI suffer a lot from emotional numbness (no feelings at all no stress/ no anxiety/no motivation/no hunger/no thirst...) and anhedonia and I also sleep a lot (like 14 hours a day) etc.¬† I suffer from all the negative symptoms of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. No psychosis for two years now.


I'm seeing a new psychiatrist for more than a year now. I've undergone a lot of tests under the supervision of a psychologist of her team.
They concluded that besides schizoaffective disorder, I also have autism + NLD and now on our last appointment this week she (my new psychiatrist) said I probably have cfs (reason why I'm sleeping so much and still being tired) and she thinks that the emotional numbness is rather caused by the autism and not the schizoaffective disorder part. I've been on paroxetine for more than six months now. I told her that the paroxetine didn't do anything for me so I suggested to taper it off. But she said we should try it with Wellbutrin this time. 


My question: (this will be understood if you read my history)
Should I try/suggest to my new psychiatrist to try Lamictal again but this time while being on an antipsychotic? While being on abilify (10 mg).¬† Lamictal was like the only medication that my body reacted to after a very very very long and exhausting period of time... It gave me energy. I know there is no solution for the emotional numbness but I just want energy so I would be able to help more with the chores at home and work parttime for example.


History:
I got emotionally numb (and I had anhedonia (couldn't enjoy anything still can't),+ apathy etc.) before I got any medication in 2016. 

Really severe numbness like I didn't/ (still don't)feel 
excitement
stress/
anxiety,
adrenaline, 
pleasure 
hunger
thirst
...
or anything AT ALL. 

So the first psychiatrist that saw me diagnosed me with depression. I refused medication. And because I was over 18, I wasn't forced to take medication. 

I didn't get better while time passed by. Still being severely emotionally numb. My parents were desperate and they insisted to give antidepressants a shot. 

My GP prescribed an antidepressant¬† (I think it was escopalitram) and slowly I started to feel good again finally and I thought the depression was gone but I became manic. 

That led to a hospitalisation at the psych ward. I was so manic that I refused medication because I believed I was healed from my depression. But than a nurse convinced me to take the prescribed medication. They put me on zyprexa and lithium (after a while the zyprexa was tapered off). I got a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and I was therefore told I had to take Lithium for the rest of my life to stay stable. 

After my stay at the psych ward I restarted at university. But than the symptoms reappeared again. I stopped taking Lithium (without the permission/knowledge of my psychiatrist) because I thought Lithium was the reason why I slept so much and was tired all the time and started to become emotionally numb again. But after a short time I got psychotic (delusions). That's when I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. 

After that my story with antipsychotics (for life) began. I was put on Zyprexa. The psychosis was gone. But I was still emotionally numb. I tried several antidepressants with it (like Venlafaxin) but nothing helped activating me or making me 'feel' again. 

Time went by and I was so depressed and had suicidal thoughts that I once again was hospitalised . 

After the psychiatrist of the depression unit saw me and listened to me (read the other doctors reports and I was tested by 2 of his psychologists ).
He didn't believe I had schizoaffective disorder. He¬† was convinced that I had bipolar disorder with psychotic features and that I was just severely depressed. 
He tapered of my antipsychotic zyprexa and we tried a couple of antidepressants. But nothing really helped with the depression. 

He¬† prescribed me Lamictal while I was now only taking Lithium and no antipsychotic. 

So I started with 25 mg Lamictal but nothing changed than after 2 weeks the dose was upped to 50 mg and I started to feel a change (It seemed like I started to feel again, I had energy to do things like cleaning for example and I enjoyed it and I started to wake up in the morning like normal people) than my dose was upped to 100 mg. That's when I became manic and after a short time also psychotic (again). 

That's when I went to the hospital again and they stopped giving me Lamictal (the psychiatrist of the depression unit was in shok and he told me he never saw a¬† patient becoming manic because of Lamictal. 
Yet he didn't taper off Lamictal but I had to quit it immediately.)
and he put me on Zyprexa and increased the Lithium dose. 

But I became emotionally numb again after the manic period was over. Now my question was... 

Should I try/suggest to my new psychiatrist to try Lamictal again but this time while being on an antipsychotic? While being on abilify (10 mg).¬† Lamictal was like the only medication that my body reacted to after a very very very long and exhausting period of time... It gave me energy. I know there is no solution for the emotional numbness but I just want energy so I would be able to help more with the chores at home and work parttime for example. 

I've been a burden for more than six years now. My parents are tired. 

What do you think? What should I do? Or what would your advice be? 

And one other thing before I got ill I used to get cold sores all the time due to stress etc. But since I got ill I don't get cold sores anymore because I don't feel stress/anxiety anymore. I find this really strange.

Sertraline Side Effects,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm kind of new to this so I hope this post is sufficient enough for info. I am a 20 y/o girl in my third year of college studying psych and I graduate in December. I started having some severe anxiety episodes where I was constantly vomiting and shaking that started in the middle of October of 2023, and I was prescribed Prozac, which made things a lot worse. I was then prescribed sertraline after taking one of those DNA medicine match tests and it showed sertraline was my best match. I am on 25mg and it has definitely helped my anxiety. I noticed I can do certain things that I couldn‚Äôt before and I‚Äôm doing better in school. However, I noticed it has really been affecting my emotions and my relationship. The best way I can explain it is that I kind of feel like a robot with very simple emotions. Things that used to make me excited don‚Äôt (for example when my bf would compliment me I would normally get warm and fuzzy inside and blush, but I don‚Äôt do that anymore), and I noticed I can‚Äôt cry and I can‚Äôt belly laugh. It is almost like when I‚Äôm interacting with people, I am reacting in the way that I would expect to react in that situation, but I don‚Äôt actually feel it. In terms of my relationship, I am experiencing heavy sexual dysfunction. I have no desire for sex or affection, and it‚Äôs almost like I am repulsed by it. I have been in my relationship with my bf for over two years, and I have explained all of this to him and I am lucky that he has been so incredibly patient. But the way I have been feeling has made my doubt my true feelings (do I still love him, have I lost feelings, etc) because I believe I do still love him and I admire him so much and I see myself spending the rest of my life with him, but I‚Äôm just not experiencing the romance. So I am at a cross roads, I don‚Äôt want to stop taking the meds because it really does help my anxiety and based on the test I did, it‚Äôs the best match, but I want to stop taking it because it‚Äôs affecting my personal and social life. I am also (to my knowledge) on the lowest dosage. And additionally to add context, I have never had problems with my emotions and sex drive before I started the meds, I actually had a really high sex drive and I am known to be an extremely expressive person. I‚Äôm making an appointment over spring break to talk to my doctor about it, but I wanted to see if anyone had/has a similar experience or any guidance on what to do.

Looking for advice on withdrawal from sertraline ,"Hello all, I hope everyone is doing well. I am a 28 year old man, married with 2 beautiful kids. 
I started 50 milligrams of sertraline daily when i was 17 years old to treat social anxiety and mild depression. I was a shy kid and struggled in large groups of people in school. 
11 years later I noticed that for a long time it seemed like, I was numbed and disconnected from my emotions/reality and I really noticed it when I had kids. Several good things have happened in my life but I‚Äôve struggled to achieve any feeling of real happiness. Most importantly, I really struggled to empathize with my wife and my kids.it seems like I forget everything and there‚Äôs this constant brain fog almost like being intoxicated.  I really don‚Äôt want to be that kind of husband or father and want to be the best version of myself for them.

Getting off sertraline - what should I expect?,"(this is kind of a vent too sorry)

Hello. So, I'm getting off meds, starting with sertraline (I take sertraline and venlafaxine for GAD and depression), and I think I am getting worse again. PMS got way more emotionally intense, which is something I experienced when I was depressed and unmedicated, and I'm generally more anxious over, well, everything. Will things get better over time? Did anyone else have a worsening period before getting better off of meds? I'm currently taking 50mg, and my psychiatrist has been lowering the dose over time. 

I'm asking bc this is actually the second time my psychiatrist tries to take sertraline off, first time was a year ago; it didn't go well and I had to take a higher dose. I thought it was the timing, things were stressful that particular year and maybe I would do better now that my life is more stable, but I'm not. I don't want to continue taking so many meds, I'm not the one paying for them and I feel like a burden to my family; I've actually been told by them that I don't want to get better and that I'm faking symptoms because of how long this treatment has been.

Nowadays, I have been taking sertraline (50 mg) for more than two months, and it has changed my life a lot. Now I can see everything more clearly, without worrying excessively and having panick attacks weekly. 

The thing is my doctor also prescribed alprazolam (1 mg), only to use it when I am feeling quite bad. However, I've been having hard weeks with some problems I cannot resolve and so I'm also taking this pill daily to feel better, which has also been great for me and helped me sleeping. 

Is it just me or am I taking to much medicine? Has anyone take the same meds together? My doctor prescribed them so I think it's alright, but I always have second thoughts with pills and their effects.",197
2nd day on Sertraline,I‚Äôve taken my second dose of sertraline tonight and so far I‚Äôve had no symptoms apart from feeling spaced out.

Escitalopram or Sertraline which is better Antidepressant?,I have Major depressive disorder. I've been taking escitalopram for the last one year but it didn't work too much on me so my doctor is thinking of giving Sertraline or paroextine. Can anyone tell me which is a better Antidepressant.,201
Serious memory issues with Seroquel (or Sertraline?),"About 4 years ago, I had a first and very difficult episode (words cannot describe it).

I was not on medication before that, but got put on seroquel and sertraline. Weight went from 170ish pounds to 280ish in 2 years (presumably from the medication); since then i've maintained it the weight by tapering the medication down (but not quitting it); but not able to lose weight.

Equally if not more difficult, I have had a really difficult time with my memory since (and I'm doing a PhD of all things). I will read something and forget what I read all the time. I will tell myself I will do something and forget. With hard work and organization, I am able to do my PhD, which is really the only thing I focus on.

Despite all this, I want to stay on the medication. Could my difficulty with memory be due to the medication? Is it worth it to change medications?

Zoloft withdrawal,"Hi does anybody have any experience with withdrawing from Zoloft?

I was taking Zoloft 25mg for 2 months and then I stopped cold turkey. It‚Äôs been 2 months since I quit and I still have emotional numbness. Does anybody know how long it takes for your emotions to return?",205
Zoloft and summer heat,"Hi everyone, this is my first ever reddit post so, I hope I can express myself correctly.

I am a 27yo woman, I work at a small restaurant near my house. I work Friday to Sunday only because I quit my full-time job this year, and I'm still trying to find a new one. I help in the kitchen but also take care of the dishes and overall cleaning the floors and etc.

The main problem is, we have no air conditioning in the kitchen at all, only at the front for the customers. Also, the worst area is behind the kitchen, in the corner, where the washing station is. Because it's a corner with no windows or air conditioner, I nearly passed out from heat various times. I always bring food from home, because they assume we eat before, which is fine but I can't survive 5h/6h without eating.

What happens is, I have no heat tolerance at all because of my medication, something I only discovered when summer started. I tried asking for a small fan and they brought a broken one to the kitchen that barely works. But what I really meant was one for the corner station, where the washing machine is, because it releases a lot of heat. (For context, I spend 1h/1h30 inside that small space cleaning dishes.)

Even my colleagues that work at the front have said to my bosses that I need something to refresh me in there, but they argue that is for ""just an hour"" and ""not necessary"".

But I am really scared because the weather is going crazy and I am getting anxious just thinking about going to work in a few hours.

I just came here to ask what should I do? And also, if anyone has the same experience with Zoloft. Thank you!",206
Zoloft experience?,"What was your experience like with Zoloft? I had been on Lexapro for 6 years, initially very successfully. However, it was starting to make me feel constantly lethargic and listless (having no desire or motivation to do anything). My doctor prescribed 150 mg of Wellbutrin on top of the lexapro - at first, I really felt the effects and felt like I was unstoppable. Now I think it‚Äôs settled in my system, and I‚Äôm a lot more energetic and enjoy doing things again, but don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm super woman. I stopped taking the lexapro basically due to a mix up with the wrong pharmacy filling my prescription and insurance wasn‚Äôt refilling it blah blah. At first without it I felt TERRIBLE (typical withdrawal) but it‚Äôs been a few weeks off it and I don‚Äôt feel as bad. Not great / super stable - sometimes I want to have a breakdown but maybe that‚Äôs just where I am in life? Anyway, I‚Äôm scared to start taking the Zoloft - I don‚Äôt know why, I‚Äôm scared it will make me worse. I‚Äôm also scared that it will make it hard to orgasm because I didn‚Äôt realize how hard lexapro made it until I started taking Wellbutrin. Anyway, please share your Zoloft story, thank you!",207
antidepressants/zoloft,"I am 20, and I was on 200mg sertraline/zoloft between ages 16 to 19. 
When I went to university, I became really burned out and at some point I took myself off my meds completely cold turkey. I have no memory of what happened afterwards; the rest of the school year is a blur. I don‚Äôt even know WHY I came off them.

Thing is, I think I want to start them again. I can‚Äôt afford a psychologist and bogstandard counselling has never worked for me so i feel like meds might be the only option. 
A lot is going wrong for me at the moment and I‚Äôm in a very dark place. But i‚Äôm scared because i‚Äôve been pretty severely dissociated for a very long time. Like I haven‚Äôt existed for years (at least that‚Äôs how it feels). And i‚Äôm scared of having to actually face things and have things actually happen to me. When i‚Äôm dissociated i know logically that things affect me, but the feelings are so muted or so distant that it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt affect me at all. 
I‚Äôm scared of having to actually face them. I‚Äôm also scared that going cold turkey might have messed my brain up. Because I was on a biiig dose, and I was on it for a while. My GP doesn‚Äôt even know that i stopped. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs going to affect me or if it will at all or if i‚Äôll go even deeper into dissociation or if i‚Äôll thrive. I‚Äôm scared because I don‚Äôt know and I hate not knowing.

I‚Äôve been on Zoloft most of my life. I saw a psychiatrist and she put me on Wellbutrin as I thought Zoloft caused my weight gain and I felt I became numb to it. My doctor then added Lexapro 5mg with the Wellbutrin and I became very down, didn‚Äôt want to really want to do anything. I stopped seeing a psychiatrist due to it becoming to expensive and at the time felt okay on the Wellbutrin and Zoloft. Then as time moved on I‚Äôve become really down and depressed. I told my primary doctor and she switched me to Zoloft 25mg instead of the Lexapro since I‚Äôve been very on edge and feel like I‚Äôm on the verge of crying all the time. I had such a bad panic attack I went to the ER. My doctor bumped me to 50MG of Zoloft and I was okay at first then I‚Äôm back to feeling very panicky and wanting to cry for no reason.

Zoloft Side Effects,"I, (17F) have been on Zoloft (50mg) for about 3 months as of now, and I notice that whenever I forget to take it in the morning, I just feel really on edge the entire day. I have very drastic mood swings, and bad anger episodes. It gets to the point where I break walls, doors, and even hit or verbally berate people. I also have the tendency to just start crying over the smallest things, as well as being incredibly restless and not able to focus or sit still for even ten seconds.

I already share a fair amount of troubles of being unable to focus and fidgeting, but whenever I forget to take my meds it just become ten times worse. I was wondering if this is normal for others, or perhaps people experience the same thing before I consult to my general practitioner.",217

How to temper Sertraline (Zoloft) withdrawals?,"Imma preface this and saying going cold turkey was never the plan but a lapse in renewing my prescription has led me to it. 

The withdrawal symptoms aren't super bad but I'm looking for some tips on how I might lessen them?

How can I get off Zoloft?,"Hi. I'm currently taking sertraline and my psych denied my prescription refill on Amazon Pharmacy for some reason and honestly it isn't really helping so I kinda want to stop taking it anyways. For those who have stopped taking it, did you just cold turkey quit or did you wean off of it. Honestly I have too much phone anxiety to call the psych after they canceled on me and denied my prescription. I just want to stop taking it and try a different doctor. Thanks!",224
Does zoloft makes you tired and unproductive?,"Like it helps with my ocd and racing thoughts cause it feels like it slows down my brain and thats good for me BUT it also makes me so tired and unproductive..

I have TOO MANY ideas and aspirations after taking Zoloft,"I had been experiencing dark depressive episodes for several years, starting during my early teens. I'm 20 now and had been going downhill over the last year battling suicidal thoughts and low motivation. Anyways, a few weeks ago I decided to reach out to a healthcare provider in order to seek guidance and emotional support (even though I was hopeless with the fact that it likely wouldnt result in anything meaningful). After talking with the GP I was asked if I wanted to try Zoloft, at first I was hesitant as I've heard horror stories surrounding SSRIs and the negative effects people have had while taking them, but despite that, I took the chance and decided to say *yes*. It cant hurt, right?   


It's been two and a half weeks after taking the medication and already I feel really good. I have ambition, drive, meaning. My creativity is almost overwhelming, and I have so many thoughts and ideas that I can't help but write, draw, and think. I wanna do this, *I want to live*. Its almost a gift and a curse. Yeah, I don't *feel* depressed but now I struggle with the perpetual drive to go go go and I'm not sure how to channel this new found energy. I mean is this normal? This is absolutely crazy and I don't know how to manage my overwhelming desires. What next, therapy? ",226
"weaning off my Zoloft, someone reassure me I‚Äôm not going insane. ","Hello! I‚Äôve been on 100mg of Zoloft for about 5 years now. It‚Äôs been great, but my exhaustion has been unreal. After talking it over with my dr, years of therapy and my major stressors for the most part gone (old job, husband drinking heavily and now sober, pregnancies and so on) we agreed we could try weaning off. 

I just dropped down to 25mg every other day, and it‚Äôs been about 4 months to get to this point. I‚Äôm not in any rush, but this has been the hardest mg drop. My anxiety is through the fucking roof! I spend all day screaming at my kids and crying when no one‚Äôs looking. I keep telling myself once my body would adjust to a change in mg before this I would start to feel great.

Any idea what would help?,"In 2017, I was in my second university year. I noticed a charming, beautiful, and intelligent classmate who seemed well-liked. Initially distant, I grew respectful and attentive towards her, holding doors, offering seats, and helping with assignments. She seemed pleased, but abruptly began ignoring me, even in class. Confused, I asked if she was upset, but she denied any issues, only to resume her cold behavior.

Developing feelings, I endured her treatment, hoping for change. Later, I learned she had started dating someone else, explaining her sudden distance. Heartbroken, I witnessed her toxic relationship from afar, feeling a mix of anger and sympathy. She was so sad, always depressed. I tried talking to her in 8 occasions over 3.5 years. Most of the times she was extra aggressive as if she means to hurt me. Few, times she was nice. Overtimes, she changed a bit, occasional attempts at conversation, I remained distant, deeply hurt by her past actions. Both of us were hurt. But I had to face it everyday since we were colleagues in everything and live nearby.

Graduating, I confessed my feelings in a letter with flowers, she was noticeably nicer to me now. However, I told her that It is hard to me to act normal since I was hurting daily over the past 3 years, acknowledging the pain caused. She expressed appreciation but admitted unintentional harm. This brought me a little closure but I felt hurt that she labels her actions over 3 years as unintentional. Something within me refusing to believe that. Later i enlisted in Military service, which provided a temporary escape, but those 14 month were extremely painful. Later, i found a job with, had a lot of female attention, I felt numb and emotionally distant. It feels like i am dead inside. And tragic encounter with her reignited old wounds, one of our colleagues died (Suicide) and I had to be there, I could not deal her even though she said hi. I just said it back and walked away as I could not be in the same space as her. Unable to cope, having suicidal thoughts for years, I quit my job and sought therapy, diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD. The doctor prescribed me Lustral which is an anti depressant and advised me to cut off several people from my past, I could not keep taking the anti depressant for more than 8 months. When i stop it, it feels like hell again, it helped me a lot but it feels like i am a drug addict. I stopped therapy for an internship in a respectable company, I wanted to be back on track and work on having a good job and a stable life again, I tried dating 2 girls but it does not feel right, somehow i keep failing in everything. It feels like I am lost. Why this keeps hurting me despite 2 years have passed since our last encounter. Currently, I am trying to move away to another country and start over. Any idea if that is right or  what should  i do ?",229
Can anyone tell me whats going?,"I get dips/episodes lasting from a few days to a few months of depression. Ranging from mild to severe. It eventually goes and I come out of it like a new person. Like I am born again. Feeling incredible for a few days and then eventually then just to normalish, able to maintain a job/college etc.

These episodes range from self isolation for days/ overdose/self harm to being able to do what I normally do but severly depressed/very emotional. Its like your drowning (dips), then your walking on water (coming out of the dip) and then swimming (inbetween the dips and coming out of it). Its like a different me. I physically feel different. And my mind. Like wearing sunglasses and then taking them off.

For me, this dips come out of nowhere, and there is no stopping it. If I am in a different country or If I won the lotto, this happens. I can not find any triggers for it. And even tho I do try to help get out of the dips (meet friends/ play music/play video games) nothing changes how I feel. Just complate sadness. Overwhelmed with sadness. Feeling so fragile. Breakdown at any moment.

Its impossible to concentrate (writing this is taking a lot of time and is painful). Concentraton has always been very difficult for me. Find it hard for things to get my attention long enough. My legs are constantly moving. I pull my hair alot. Fidget alot.Pick my lips, Grabbing things.Even to the point where I will punch things. I even started munching on my gaming chair one night. Difficulty waiting my turn/ listening to other people.

Its very difficult to sleep. I always had sleep problems my life. Faling asleep in class etc. Trying to concentrate in school/colllege was very difficult. Always late for school/work. But when it comes to nighttime, I feel better. I feel more awake t night and can do things much better. I feel much clearer. Its horrible going through the tired, fighting not to fall asleep but when it comes to night you cant sleep. It doesnt matter how much sleep I get either, Im always tired. I have to sleep with the TV on at a small volume.

Whats really difficult during this episode is the panic/frustration. Most evenings it comes. Cant sit/stand, pacing, overwhelming, i got to go, i got to do something-PANIC. I have to keep busy as much as I can. The toughts of just sitting at home most days drives me crazy. I have never spent so much time in the gym ever in my life. I dont really thing Im anxious. A lot of the time outside tho, its lke im ready to start a fight wih a stranger. Doing things to get a reaction from people. Snapping at famiy members too. Extremely irritable. Ready to breakdown in tears. I have to rely to Seroquel/Xanax to calm me down somewhat.

I have NO DRIVE/AMBITION, even tho I have the want and the dreams of doing something with my life. I believe am a very smart and talented person but never been able to do anything with it. And its very frustrating. I want to change BUT I cant. Even tho I have tried all my life.

Medications I have tried so far - Lexapro/Trintellix/Sertraline/Effexor XL/Mirtazipine/Amitryptaline/Lyrica/Abilify/Seroquel/Olanzapine/Xanax/Valium

I currently seeing a Psychologist for about 8 months now. He introduced me to Schema Thrapy. And he is very good and have learned a lot from him about myself, but Im finding it very difficult to understand that he believes that its my thinking and there is triggers that I get myself into this dips. Maybe he is right and I just cant see at this moment. I also did Personality Disorder Tests and it said that I dont have Borderline Personality Disorder. But ihave Depressive/Dependent traits. I seen a Psychiatrist again to day and took me off lustral (said there is no point intaking it if it doesnt work) so now I am just on Seroquel 12.5mg twice in the evening. Its very frustrating talking to these people and you barely get a response from them. When your telling them how much pain you are in, even after an overdose, there response is to increase the drug your own, give you an antipsychotic, see you in three months, bye!!! Never telling me what exactly is going on, just that I am depressed and anxious.

The only thing keeping me going is my family. Id hate to put them through anymore pain. I hate to think of my mother losing her son, what it would do to her. Another thing that keeps me going is the periods in my life where things where normal. I could enjoy maintain a lot of things in my life. I dont want to die but I dont want to to live either. If i have o keep going through this all my life, Im 32, or if I can not change, I dont want to go through life with this. I get some comfort in thinking about asissted suicide (dignity in dying). Not being in pain. That I have tried everything. Just the thought of being free.

I am always on the phone, mindlessly scrolling, and gambling, and a lot of pornography. Going on sites looking to meet some random people but never going through wth it. Having a few drinks does wonders for me. Feeling better, not irritable/restless. 

Another thing bothering my is tics/twitches. They get really bad when I am in a dip/episode. I am currently on a waiting list to see a neurologist as I get a lot pains and my hands/thumb is in a lot of pain. I especially get a lot of pins/needles in my hands too.

If you have read this far. Thank you very much for reading. If anyone has gone through what I have, and recovered, Or if anyone has any suggestions on what it could possibly be, I look forward to hearing from you.",230

Duloxetine and its side effects and how it changed my life for the better.,"I was so depressed and I mean it was real bad and I was very close 3 times and called 988 twice and a ER visit once. I was 60 at the time and 61 now. Last year I was going down hill fast. I was suffering hard from PTSD, anxiety and  Borderline personality disorder.  I was having terrible flashbacks at night, and for years I suffered from suicidal ideation and there wasn't ever a moment when I didn't think about it and it just creeps inside my head. 

And to stop my flashbacks and those thoughts I self harmed so much that I ended up in an ER. I tweeted a picture of I had done and I have over 5000 followers and many  told me to get help, I've never been one to ask for help. I grew up in the streets of Hollywood, From the age of 14 I hustled those streets for 18 + years and I never needed anybody's help. 

Deep down I knew I needed help and I needed it badly, that meant I had to meet and trust new people from mental health places, I tried it in the past and it never worked for me. A lot people on twitter, my fans, convinced me to try again. I went asked for help at a local mental health place near me. 

I was put on Duloxetine and Seroquel in the middle July and I waited and it seemed like nothing was happening, weeks went by and still nothing then on August 15th I noticed I wasn't thinking about suicide, that idealization was gone. 

My life got a 100 times better, and I'm shocked it worked and I still am. I also suffer from chronic pain in my neck and lower back. I'm on disability SSI and one day my neighbor asked I wanted work with him at this house that was getting rebuilt. Within two weeks I was working two jobs making $25 and hr. and the other $20 an Hr.  as a finished Carpenter. I've never done that type of work in my life, sure I've done basic construction and whatnot but nothing like the $25 an hr. job. 

I worked everyday including weekends, I still wore my neck-brace to help with the pain but somehow Duloxetine made me like that sort of work. 

Before Duloxetine  the thought of pounding nails and on my knees, I would never touch that because I knew I'd lose interest because of the pain and the depression that came with and I would quit.  I was hooked on working this kind of work and I loved it. This young guy saw my work at a job and was so impressed he asked if I wanted to work with him. So one of my jobs was finished, a huge house 5 bedrooms, 7 beds, 4 baths over looking the Puget Sound. 

Sam the young guy finally asked if I wanted to work the next day and I did. The second day I fell off the roof trying to step down off onto a 6 foot ladder.  Falling 9 feet is like getting hit by a vehicle and I've been by a car before.  After I gathered myself, to me a good 10 minutes or so. Sam asked me if I needed him to drive me an ER, I told him no finish your that already bid on.  Faster it's done the more money is made in that type of work. 

Side effects of Duloxetine for me has been extreme weight loss and night sweats from hell. With Duloxetine I have zero appetite, and I'm not and never have been a foody type of person and I hate to cook food. I'm 6.1 and my weight goes up and down mostly down, that day I weighed 155 pounds. I weigh myself every morning and force myself to drink 8 bottled of water through the day, 4 bottles on the way to work everyday.  I don't like taking a lunch when I work, interrupts my flow and I hate that.  So I'd eat those packets of tuna. 

 I am unusually skinny from the meds and I went to  Allenmore Hospital Emergency Department here in Tacoma they assumed I was a drug user, they didn't believe I fell off a roof, and I explained to them I know what I look like and it's a daily battle to keep fed and hydrated. They gave me CT scans and then said my injuries aren't that serious and I have no broken cracked bones and you can go back to work in a couple of days.

As I was leaving a nurse exclaimed: Good news Mr. XXXX you don't have any broken or cracked ribs, with a huge S eating grin and her thumbs up. I thought that was oddly specific and they way she said it, like being sarcastic. 

5 days later after trying to work and I knew I had at least two broken ribs, I feel them, so went to another ER and they did CT scans and I had two fractured ribs. I get weird looks everywhere I go, I get drug tested with every doctor visit, they think I'm using drugs. I go to therapy twice a month, I see my psychiatrist once a month & she calls me to check up on me. 

I have a history of drug use, I haven't used since 2000. I made a huge mistake by telling a doctor that when I was 15 my pimp would shoot me up with heroin so to make it easy on me with the tricks.  

So they never give me pain meds and if they it's 2  or 5 pain meds. Allenmore gave me 5 and when I picked them I threw them away, it wasn't enough to deal the pain I had and it made me angry.  When did doctors become our adversaries, and why is it not a good thing to tell a doctor about your past. I only told him that because he wasn't believing I had neck pain & thought I was drug seeking. I was trying to assure him that I was done with that life and it was long time ago and wasn't relevant now.  

I'm faced with a discrimination I've never experienced before, I got the same treatment at the other ER also. The doctor was a real jerk to me, I even filed a complaint against him and I'm to sue Allenmore and if I can't I'm going to filed a complaint at them as well. 

Despite all that I still am very happy and enthusiastic about starting my  days. ",238
How long did your brain zaps last after ending duloxetine/cymbalta?,"Just wondering how long people experiences of brain zaps lasted? I've tapered from 60mg to 20mg over the last few months but am on day three of dropping from 20mg to 0mg.

The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm All Better‚Äù cycle sucks.,"Hi everyone!

I take an SSRI for anxiety/depression (duloxetine). When I take it consistently, I feel great, then somehow convince myself I‚Äôm ‚Äúhealed‚Äù and no longer need it. 

Surprise surprise

That‚Äôs not how it works.

By the time that stupid thought process wears off, I feel terrible. I‚Äôm anxious, crying, having an existential crisis.

When in actuality, my life is really great.

Then I take the medication again, then the cycle repeats.

What is this even called? 

I know logically I need to take the medication, but it‚Äôs like my whole thought process around taking medication changes once I feel better.

This cycle is painful for me but more importantly, my loved ones.

I mentioned this to my therapist and he just told me to take them.

Which is fair advice, but I don‚Äôt know how to explain this process. How I think about my medication and how I feel do a complete 180¬∞.

Has anyone else experienced this? ",244
Doctors screwed up my medication,"I think that my doctors have messed up my medication. I know I can‚Äôt ask for medication advice but any similar experiences would be really appreciated. 

SO‚Ä¶ I have been on one antidepressant or another for over 10 years, I was most recently on duloxetine 120mg. This wasn‚Äôt working for me so my doctors decided to try me again with Sertraline as I have OCD and it‚Äôs meant to be most effective for it. Fine, no problems, I ask about cross tapering and managing this‚Ä¶

My GP insists that I don‚Äôt need to reduce and I can do a straight swap‚Ä¶ (he also thought that duloxetine was a tricyclic not an SNRI but I didn‚Äôt want to argue about it). So he just gives me 100mg sertraline to start with no transition. 

So I pick up my medication and check with the pharmacist, she vanished for about 15 minutes trying to find out but she wasn‚Äôt sure but thought it would be okay‚Ä¶ (spoiler alert: it wasn‚Äôt okay) 

I‚Äôm three days in, so emotional, so anxious and depressed, horrific intrusive thoughts, I don‚Äôt feel safe. I feel so much guilt for putting all of this onto my boyfriend too, but he is so loving and supportive. 

So I Google it, and so much literature about reducing duloxetine to 60mg and then stopping to start on a low dose of Sertraline. But no‚Ä¶ my doctor had me stop 120mg of duloxetine and straight away start 100mg sertraline. I‚Äôm fuming. 

But what am I meant to do now? Contact my doctors? They‚Äôre the ones that caused this mess! I‚Äôm in the UK if anyone has any ideas.",245

I‚Äôve just gotten to the point where I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything. I‚Äôve tried multiple types of therapy such as cbt, dbt, group therapy, etc and none of it has helped despite me feeling like I‚Äôve tried so hard to commit to it. I‚Äôve also tried a number of medications such as

Combining different types of anti depressants?,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone has experience of combining 2 different types of anti depressants?

Does having nightmares mean I have a bigger problem?,"Hi,

2 weeks ago I stopped taking duloxetine, withdrawal was terrible.

Last 4 days were normal, everything was okay.

Now, again I have the issue with dreams and sleeping, I do not know if it is correlated but...

I wake up 2 hours after going to sleep, due to nightmares. They are not so terrible (no monsters, zombies or whatever) - the worst is that feeling which accompanies them (strong saddness/anxiety/fear).

After waking up I still feel it, like if something was about to happen. It is not so easy to get rid of that nasty feeling.


I read somewhere that nightmares are a symptom of some mental problems. Or is it just anxiety symptom?

I do not know ehat to think about it and just wanted to talk about it with you guys",248
"Being discharged from CMHT for not responding to treatment, suicidal. ","I don't even know what to say. I've been on 6 antidepressants, they told me I don't communicate well enough to be able to do therapy. My next appointment is tomorrow but I read my notes from my last review and it essentially says they're planning on discharging me because I haven't gotten any better. In what world is this right? Surely patients who aren't getting better are the ones that need help the most? They haven't even exercised all their options, there are classes of antidepressant I haven't been put on yet, and the ones they have tried they haven't given me long enough prescriptions for. Some of them have been for 1 week, 2 weeks, I haven't been on any longer than a month. It's like they haven't even tried but they're blaming me for not improving. I truly want to end my life now, this was my only hope and if they discharge me, I have no other services to get help from. The IAPT said my case was too complex for them to handle.

This is what the CMHT wrote in my last review:

> We felt the best way forward at the moment was for her to take the Duloxetine as originally planned. If this was effective then we could move on to the next stage. If this is ineffective then we are limited in our options as to what can be tolerated and it may be that we do not consider medication as a viable option. We do not feel that it will be beneficial to continue to offer various types of medications as this clearly reduces her overall sense of hope.

> We agreed that [care coordinator] would be in contact with her next week to look at next steps and that we will review things again once we are able to see how the Duloxetine has gone. [My name] gives a sense of being disappointed by this however this has always been her presentation and we feel that the best way forward at this moment in time is to make small clinically informed decisions to see if she is willing to work with us on these. This is felt to be within her best interests otherwise we would be unable to move forward and we will struggle to develop any form of meaningful engagement.

> Should we not be able to do this following a further trial of medication and various suggestions about how she can develop psychological engagement, it may be that we consider that Monntana has a time away from services to collect her thoughts and to return when she feels more able to express herself. This obviously carries an element of risk in that she may feel rejected by this approach however when she attends and we are unable to meet her needs this may be a more risk laden approach as this can decrease her hope. 

I'm being left to fend for myself. I don't understand how their main concern could be decreasing my hope and yet they fail to see how discharging me leaves me with absolutely no hope at all.

Antidepressant Cymbalta/Duloxotine withdrawal: Suggestions for dealing with the symptoms or speeding up?,"28 yr old female who has been on Cymbalta for about 6 years to treat Generalized Anxiety disorder and Fibromyalgia symptoms. I was taking 60mg twice per day and then was only taking one 60mg once per day for 2 weeks as suggested by my doctor before starting a new antidepressant prescription: 10mg of Aventyl to eventually get up to taking 5 10mg pills per day. 

The reason I wanted to switch to a different antidepressant was because if was no longer working for me. 

I thought I was dying or losing my mind or something until I Googled how long duloxotine/Cymbalta withdrawal can last and apparently it can be up to 3 or even 6 weeks! It's been only one week. I told my doctor about my concerns about the withdrawal symptoms from the times I've run out in the past and that's why we tapered the dosage but... obviously it didn't work. 

My withdrawal symptoms: 
.

. Insomnia. My ADHD symptoms are so much worse and my brain won't shut up and let me fall asleep. When the insomnia goes on for too long I start to disassociate and have difficulty determining if I'm awake or sleeping. Things get trippy while awake like I'm wearing someone's glasses or looking in a fun house mirror. Sometimes its like I'm stuck in the Dolly zoom camera effect in movies where I feel like I should have physically reached somewhere by now...
.

. Severely vivid nightmares when I do manage to fall asleep every single night. Sometimes they will wake me up in a full blown Anxiety attack. I'll also wake up drenched in sweat and my entire body clenched tight. Even when I run my air conditioner as low as it can go in my room in hopes of it helping me have a deeper sleep, I can wake up drenched in sweat like I was in a sauna.
.

. Exhaustion from the lack of sleep, causing significantly worse ADHD symptoms, worse anxiety symptoms, causing very low mood and no motivation to do anything. I could burst out I tears over the tiniest provocation right now. 
.

. Diarrhea and indigestion. Either the stress and my whole life being out of whack is causing my IBS symptoms to flare up or its happening on it's own. I could eat something like beets at a very late lunch at 2pm and see the beets again at 7pm. Nothing looks fully digested. 
.

. Nausea, indigestion and bloating is making me very hesitant to eat at a regular schedule. 
.

. Vertigo/lightheadedness/tinnitus. Ps, this is not exactly textbook symptom and when the problem starts up again it is a bit of a mystery. Had seen a ENT and had an MRI a few years back to try to figure it out but there was no obvious cause. Essentially I get a pulsing feeling in my ears and a high pitched bell ""üéµbringggüéµ bringgggüéµ"" sound in my ears like an old fashioned telephone and sometimes my eyes flicker like the lights are dimming during a storm or power outage..... but this happens specifically when my eyeballs move side to side but not up and down.... this symptom might just be a coincidence too. Very light vertigo, mostly foggy lightheadedness. 



The insomnia, nightmares and diarrhea are the biggest problems right now and its making me beyond miserable and feeling like I'm losing my mind.

Took my first dose of venlafaxine/effexor (no side effects yet). Should I reconsider whether I take venlafaxine or stick with it?,"TLDR: Anxious about using venlafaxine after hearing the horror stories. Should I stop taking it after my first 37.5mg dose and talk to my psychiatrist, or just stick with it and try it out?

Hello all, I hope this is the right place to post this.

I saw a psychiatrist for the first time and they prescribed me 37.5mg of venlafaxine (generic effexor) for my depression and mild anxiety. I took my first dose about an hour ago, and while I feel alright, I am completely freaked out by the possible side effects and withdrawal symptoms. I am kicking myself for not researching the medicine more closely before taking it, and seriously considering just stopping for now and talking to my psych again. I have heard the success stories but I am very scared about all the horror stories. (I am also really forgetful and have a poor track record with keeping a sleep schedule so I am deathly afraid of missing some days)

1. Can I stop taking venlafaxine now with minimal withdrawal symptoms since it was just the one dose?
2. Am I overreacting to the venlafaxine horror stories? Or should I seriously consider not taking it?

I am getting worked up thinking about this stuff and think maybe I should have a more thorough discussion with my psychiatrist before I commit fully to venlafaxine. It seems that 25% of people swear by it and the other 75% wish they never took it in the first place (I know it is all relative).

Doc also prescribed me hydroxyzine to take only if I get some anxiety (or apparently nausea) so that has been a nice security blanket to have. I am also \~200lbs and 6' so perhaps the effects will be less severe to start with.

Thank you all in advance.",266
Venlafaxine(Effexor) is the devil,"
TL:DR
 I‚Äôm going cold turkey on this because it ruins my life

Hello guys üëãüèª
I‚Äôm diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression and was put on Venlafaxine a lil bit more than half a year ago. Little to say it numbed all my emotions it also numbed my sexual drive, sexual functioning and libido to non existent. As a person with extremely high sexual drive I felt even better at first. First time in my life my horniness doesn‚Äôt control me and my mind. In the emotion aspect I didn‚Äôt feel really a significant change, that‚Äôs when I told my doctor I think we should try something else. Instead she increased the dose and I was put on 225mg. I met a very nice girl recently (around 1.5 months ago) and we started dating very seriously. We felt very emotionally connected - same interests, hobbies, etc. We have met almost every other day. First time in my life I felt so connected to a human being. When it came to bed she said she doesn‚Äôt feel any sexual chemistry between us - oh boy she was right, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything - let alone ejaculate or to even maintain an erection. I decided to go cold turkey on this devil med a few days ago and I‚Äôm already starting to feel better sexually. Today the girl decided to end our relationship because as I said she thinks we are not sexually compatible. And I feel like I potentially lost the love of my life thanks to a stupid med.
I opened up to her about this problem a few days ago but I don‚Äôt think she realised to what extent my sexual drive was off. It was literally in shambles.
I don‚Äôt know what to do now, no way I‚Äôm taking this med ever again, I don‚Äôt recommend it to my worst enemy‚Ä¶

Mood changes after dropping dose of venlafaxine,"Hey I started on antidepressants (venlafaxine 75mg)for menopause symptoms over a year ago. Been having a hard time lately because of a sudden break up from a 33 year relationship. 
Couldn‚Äôt see my regular doctor, different doctor upped my dose to 112.5mg. After 2 weeks of the higher dose I felt terrible, crying all the time and getting that weird head feeling you get when you forget your tablets but would get it about 30 mins after taking them.
Finally got into my regular doctor who told me to go back to my normal dose. 
It‚Äôs been just over a week now since I went back to the original, lower dose and still feeling like crying, depressed and weird head feeling.
Wondering if anyone knows how long it takes for mood to stabilise? ",268
Venlafaxine,"Hi all,

I was on 225mg venlafaxine for 2 years whilst taking 30mg Ritalin.

I have been in and out of hospital the last 6 months wondering what the heck was happening, constant migraines, dizziness, etc.

Anyway, had a GP Review which he has immediately suspended my Ritalin and has reduced my Venlafaxine.

I have serotonin syndrome like symptoms and have to get regular blood tests whilst im being tapered off.

&#x200B;

I expressed my concerns of the high dose of venlafaxine and Ritalin together because i looked and they're both stimulants, nope, was told it's safe, and then all of a sudden, it wasn't.

&#x200B;

Has anyone had something similar?   


ALSO, Venlafaxine withdrawals? they're horrid!!!

Venlafaxine & Bupropion to Trintellix and Vyvanse,"Hi wondering if anyone has switched from venlafaxine (Effexor) and bupropion (Wellbutrin) to Trintellix and vyvanse?  I have GAD and MDD as well as BED. My psychiatrist suggested to add in naltrexone for now but if no luck with that for the BED then he thinks it‚Äôs time to totally med change. 
Obviously I have fear, thank u anxiety. Just wondering if anyone takes trentillex and vyvanse together or even just trentillex or has come off venlafaxine and felt well",270
Venlafaxine and sweat,"Does it ever get better? I sweat so much!!! Is so uncomfortable, specially cause the sweat comes from my head/hair. Everyday it feels like I'm running a marathon. I've been on it for about 2-3 months, does it ever get better?",271
Venlafaxine and severe joint pain?,"I don‚Äôt know where else to turn‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm suffering with crippling joint pain. In particular my hips but effecting my wrists, ankles, fingers, jaw‚Ä¶.
The *only* thing to have changed is my meds back in august‚Ä¶. Could it be this? 
I‚Äôm is so so much pain I‚Äôm literally in tears‚Ä¶. 
I can‚Äôt find anything that particularly links venlafaxine to joint pain‚Ä¶
I had an awful time transitioning off duloxetine to venlafaxine and can‚Äôt bare the thought of going through that again‚Ä¶. But would do it in a moment if this pain would stop‚Ä¶ 
Initially I thought it was hormones as I stopped the pill‚Ä¶. But I‚Äôve been back on that over 6 weeks and no let up. 
FYI. I‚Äôm a 29 year old female. Reasonably healthy. Could do more exercise as I have a desk job. But do get out on walks when I can and have been incorporating yoga into my daily routine to try ease the pain and build strength. Have a 4 year old daughter so out and about a lot. 
Please anything you have experienced or read much appreciated.",272
Coming off Effexor/venlafaxine?,"I‚Äôve been on venlafaxine (225mg) for about 6 years now and I am desperate to come off it so I can actually feel some emotions again, and not just completely flat. 
Anyone that has come off it have any suggestions or any advice on how to make it less difficult than it‚Äôs going to be? 
Will be talking to my psychologist next session and having her help the process but just want some help from those with previous experience with it",273
More venlafaxine (Effexor) or less?,"I‚Äôve been on Effexor ER for about 10 weeks now (first 37.5mg, then 75mg).

It‚Äôs making me feel much happier, reducing anxiety and depression, but I‚Äôm increasingly unable to focus on or even take an interest in doing anything (much more than before starting it). I‚Äôm just ok doing nothing. 

Is this an indication that the drug is not the right one and i need try another, or that I‚Äôm experiencing a partial response and need to increase the dosage? 

Curious how I should expect my doctor to react when I see him next.",274
Venlafaxine (Effexor etc) for the first time>,"What were your experiences in the early days of trying this?

I took my first one (75mg) on Thursday (idk if it counted fully as I was stupid, ignored instructions, took on empty stomach and was sick a lot but since then been keeping them down with food) and the last couple of days I've gone into total overdrive - my bedroom has been a total s\*\*thole for ages because of executive dysfunction, hoarding, various mental illnesses being fun etc. I'm resting now as worn self out for the moment but I've nearly finished clearing it and hoovering cobwebs and I can't even explain how big of a job it was, like 5 or so binliners full maybe closer to 10 especially as I haven't finished yet. Then I'm gonna clean it all. But I'm enjoying whatever this is. Idk if it's a case of new medication side effects or halfway into a long break from work and done nothing yet kicking in.

I also so far have loads of energy and not so much sleep (a plus for me as instead of sleeping for 24 hours out of depression, I stayed up for around 20 hrs yesterday and slept for maybe 6 and was awake. It's 12:30am here, been awake since about 11am and don't think I've eaten but not much of an appetite but will make sure I eat to take next tablet

Anyone had similar side effects starting out on these? Thanks :)",275
Venlafaxine increase,"Hi there! For many months my depression has been very severe. Recently, approximately four weeks ago, I went up on my venlafaxine. I‚Äôve increased my dosage before, and it usually leaves me feeling more tired, slightly anxious and spacey/disconnected for the first several weeks, before it makes me feel better. Do other people experience this? I‚Äôm a bit nervous that the change isn‚Äôt going to make me feel better. Ig I‚Äôd just like to know that other people feel funny for a bit after increasing the dosage?",276
Is it possible to dissolve venlafaxine (instant release) tablets?,"Hello, I‚Äôm having pretty bad swallowing issues which I think are related to TMJ and tight throat muscles when taking venlafaxine tablets orally. 

Can I dissolve the tablets in water and drink the mixture that way? 

Thanks in advance",277
Started venlafaxine 2 days ago,I dont like the symptoms and want to stop taking them. Do i have to taper off even though its only been 2 days or can i just stop taking them? Heard alot of bad things about stopping it so wanted to get honest opinions on here. Ps called my dr about this and left a message but no response yet,278
Venlafaxine and Quetiapine,I usually take venlafaxine in the morning and quetiapine before bed. I forgot to take venlafaxine this morning. Is it okay to take it with quetiapine at the same time tonight?,279
Should I go off Venlafaxine ER?,"I've been on venlafaxine extended release/effexor for 6 years, even throughout my pregnancy. I am strongly considering going off of it/taking a break and I wanted to understand what to expect (not withdrawal symptoms- I will taper and am more than prepared and aware of this). Has anyone gone off effexor and found it to be a good experience for them?

I've been on various medications for generalized anxiety disorder for most of my life. I've also been in therapy and have been completely stable and have sound coping strategies, resources (yoga etc) and friends/family I can rely on. The medicine has helped, I think but I honestly can't say I know for sure. I'm feeling increasingly uncomfortable taking something that has been significantly altering my brain chemistry for so long without really understanding it. I am not nor have I ever been suicidal. My anxiety management is a daily thing that I am aware of and prepared to deal with more directly if it comes back by going off the medicine. 

Why don't I ask my doctor? Well, I have. It's very hard to find a good psychiatrist in Austin. Especially one who takes insurance. I found a decent one who gives me what I need but I don't trust him much. He is always trying to get me to smoke weed and while I got nothing against it, I have said a million times it's not my thing. I don't like the way it makes me feel. It gives me more anxiety. Yet he doesn't remember or care so asks everytime. Also he's kinda weird about my relationship with my wife. Like boomer questions. Anyways I've asked and he dismisses me. So I just want to manage it myself through a taper process. 

I'm prepared for the immediate side effects but wanted to know more medium to long term if anyone has gone off of SNRIs and what your experiences have been?",280
Getting off Venlafaxine,"For reference, I am 18F and I‚Äôve been on 225mg venlafaxine er for about 4 years, probably longer. 

I no longer suffer from the same symptoms that made it necessary for me to take this medication at such a high dose. I am suspicious of the high risk of dependency and therefore want to get off of this medication, although my psychiatrist and my parents (who still essentially control my medication at this point, I just graduated high school) are very against my stopping this medication. 

I don‚Äôt feel like the drug has even helped my depression, although that‚Äôs likely some sort of bias on my part. It has hindered me in some ways though, mainly in just killing my emotional response to most things and causing sexual dysfunction that created problems in my high school relationships‚Ä¶which makes me worry about the future. 

After searching for how to ween off, I was hit with so many results describing an impossible task. Withdrawal symptoms for months, some never stopping. I haven‚Äôt ever been able to go more than maybe 36 hrs with this medication. I don‚Äôt want to be dependent on this for life and it‚Äôs scares me so much. And it makes me really fucking angry because I was barely a teenager when they put me on this shit. 

Does anyone have even a remotely positive experience coming off of venlafaxine/effexor er? Any and all stories about coming off of the medication welcome.",281
Sudden extreme feelings about a month after starting Venlafaxine (self harm TWs),"Seemed to be adjusting to it and doing pretty ok. For a few days recently I hadn't taken it as was my first prescription for it and needed to phone to get more and couldn't cos work (extra info, my mum phoned for me and receptionist told her I was ""old enough to phone myself"" - when I was eventually able to I admit it was very fun getting the same lady and politely confronting her about that haha)

Anyway, after taking them again for a day or two (I'd only missed occasional days and spaced them out when running low) , I feel weird. Angry. Like really angry and weird. Intense anger like I haven't felt in years. I threw my sandwiches and plate across my room after literally punching the sandwiches for not being right. I screamed at my mum for knocking my door when deliveroo couldn't accept my order because I'd already told her not to knock. I took two (75mg) tablets tonight and I don't think I've everr taken extra antidepressants, I just felt like it. I'm having recurring thoughts of stabbing my wrists deep and just drawing the knife downwards to open up the wounds more. I don't intend to SH but this is strange. Is this a normal way to feel when adjusting to venlafaxine or am I just totally losing it?",282
Been taking 37.5 venlafaxine for 4 days and it is hell,"I was given this in the mental hospital, and told them I only wanted to be on something short term. I don‚Äôt know why the hell they put me on this because i was NEVER informed about the withdrawal symptoms. I asked the nurses there twice to print me off a list of the symptoms and they never did. Looking up now people have horrible withdrawals coming off of this. The doctor isn‚Äôt there until tomorrow but I can‚Äôt take this another day.. I am so irritable and in a worse headspace then when I initially went. I am taking Trazadone at night as well, do you think this would help with the withdrawals only taking venlafaxine for 4 days at the lowest dose?

edit: I did ask what the symptoms were to the doctor and all he said is that it would make me a little nauseas for a couple days",283
Poem about my experience on venlafaxine/effexor,"**I would love to know what some people thought of my poem if you feel so inclined :)**

**VENLAFAXINE**

My thoughts have been clouded, my emotions unsteady, and overall, I was in a state of denial

About all the serious side effects this drug has had on me now for a long while

Venlafaxine/Effexor whatever you want to call it

Has significantly impacted my thoughts, feelings, work, relationships, and has caused my moods to shift

I have desperately been doing (or so I thought) everything in my power that would allow these moods to lift

Many people have had short- and long-term positive effects with this medication

However, MY side effects have never fully ceased regardless of my level of consistency, support, and unwavering dedication

I thought there was something wrong with me and that I had some sort of flawed personality

Even though there was sometimes improvement- the painful symptoms would never decrease in totality

I allowed myself to be na√Øve and uninformed even when I had access to the facts

Doing enough consistent research on this drug is clearly an area of mine that significantly lacks

Now that I am transitioning off the drug, NOW I do my research and it makes so much sense to me

I am trying to forgive myself for it taking this long to realize and see what was right in front of me

End of story, it is a medication that helps with depression and anxiety is what I told myself

Any doubts I ever had were automatically brushed off and put far away on the shelf

Well, these previous doubts are now being removed off the shelf and brought back out

I now know the serious/life-changing effects this has had on me without a doubt

Here are some the side effects that I have had recently and in the not-so-distant past

¬∑ Tiredness

¬∑ Yawning

¬∑ Unusual dreams

¬∑ Tremor or shaking

¬∑ Dizziness

¬∑ Blurry vision

¬∑ Feeling anxious, nervous, and jittery

¬∑ Thoughts of dying

¬∑ New or worsened depression

¬∑ New or worsened panic attacks

¬∑ Agitation, restlessness, anger and/or irritability

¬∑ Serotonin Syndrome which has caused:

¬∑ Agitation

¬∑ Hallucinations

¬∑ Coordination problems

¬∑ Muscle twitches

¬∑ Racing thoughts

¬∑ Excessive happiness or irritability

¬∑ Talking more or faster than usual

¬∑ Seizures (not sure if it was in my case or not-they still haven‚Äôt been officially proven by catching them on a machine-just based on MY oral report to doctors based on OTHER PEOPLE‚ÄôS observations and assumptions to what it may be)

¬∑ Feeling unsteady

¬∑ Confusion

¬∑ Problems concentrating

¬∑ Thinking or memory problems

¬∑ Causing other medications that you are taking to be less effective

¬∑ Venlafaxine is also the drug MOST LIKELY to cause withdrawal symptoms while weaning off it such as:

¬∑ Extreme fatigue

¬∑ Flu-like symptoms like chills

¬∑ Brain fog

¬∑ And some or many of the previous symptoms that occur when you were taking your usual dose

¬∑ It may also cause ‚Äúbrain zaps‚Äù (I haven‚Äôt experienced those yet and hopefully will not in this process)

I am glad I now have this level of awareness despite how long it took

Trying so hard to forgive myself during this process of giving my health and life another careful look

I know this was all due to something medical that was beyond my control

But I am unable forget the impact it had on myself and others-a very painful and/or uncomfortable toll

I have never been the friend, acquaintance, colleague, or witnessing stranger of another person having an anxiety or panic attack right in front of me

I empathize with what a confusing and uncomfortable experience that must be

I know our country has made a lot of progress in accepting people who battle mental illness, but we still have so much further to go

The pain you feel, the confusion, and loneliness is a challenge that only the people who have experienced it truly know

Even then it is still on a spectrum-there is no one size fits all

Some people need therapy alone with no medication at all

While others need both during a life-long process of trying to heal

Some turn to alcohol, other drugs, overeating, and excessive spending-anything at all that will temporarily decrease how they feel

Even when you do ‚Äúwhat you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed to do‚Äù there are often new challenges to face

Making you lose hope that you may never get out of this place

I know my current self-doubt, anxiety, and daily concerns are being influenced by withdrawal symptoms from gradually stopping this medication

I still am trying to remain positive that when it is finally out of my system, I will be able to rejoice in utter celebration

I pray that the symptoms I have had (and many I am still going through) that I could not control will not have irreparable damaging affects to my relationships with the people that I have come to adore

Losing many or all the good relationships with the colleagues that I respect, my bosses, my good acquaintances, friends, and close friends would hurt me to the core

It would seem crazy and cruel not to forgive someone who had a heart attack, stroke, or another deadly disease but this is not what we are dealing with here

Mental illness is still controversial, it makes people uncomfortable-there continues to be that fear

I just want to be understood by some to any degree that they can

I want to be accepted as I strive through dedication and actions to be the healthiest and happiest person that I can

I understand and I accept that I am not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea

To some (or maybe many) I think too deeply, I‚Äôm too emotionally expressive, direct, sensitive, real, and complicated-those people want nothing to do with me

And that‚Äôs fine, I don‚Äôt need everyone to accept me-I just hope those I care for can value, respect, and hopefully even like and appreciate some or all my redeeming qualities

I am thoughtful, empathetic, reliable, and have a good sense of humor- I know others have these traits too and they are hardly ""me only"" anomalies

Support from caring people in your life that accept you is an important part of the healing process for those that can give to the degree that they can

I insist that this is a two-way street, I commit to giving to the ones I care for-I am dedicated to them too and making myself understand

I know some people with good intentions don‚Äôt know what to do or say-so it is more comfortable to do nothing

Reaching out, listening, accepting, spending time or anything else IS SOMETHING

And it helps and it matters so much to know some people truly care

To whatever degree and extent that they can be there

We all matter, and we all do better with loving, caring, and supportive people in our lives

As we go through the unknowns of this world-being our best self is what so many of us want and what are heart strives",284
Venlafaxine - sexual side effects.,"I was on Venlafaxine a little while back, for one week, and I stopped as (TMI), when I orgasmed nothing came out (I‚Äôm a guy) and I was like I can‚Äôt deal with that. I read up on it and it‚Äôs supposedly the worst antidepressant for sexual side effects - killing your drive, weak erections and my side effect. I have one female friend who said the same, and then another female friend, who interestingly, I know has always had a very low sex drive, but she says since being on Venlafaxine it has increased this and she says she has highest libido she‚Äôs ever had. 

My question is, has anyone else experienced increased libido on this? I‚Äôve never heard of that in regards to Venlafaxine, as mentioned it‚Äôs supposed to be the worst for it and out of all the antidepressants I‚Äôve taken I‚Äôve never had one that made nothing come out when I orgasmed like Venlafaxine did.

I just started taking Venlafaxine (Effexor)‚Ä¶ anybody else?,"This is the second medication I‚Äôm trying ‚Ä¶ a year ago I was on duloxitine (sp?) for a few months.. didn‚Äôt do much for me. So the VA prescribed me this‚Ä¶ I am on day 3, I realize it‚Äôll take a few weeks to kick in‚Ä¶ anybody have any experience with this medication? How is your experience with it?

Long story short, I have been toeing the line with suicide. No intentions but the thought is there. Heavily. I am always tired.. not sleepy, but drained.. always irritable.. quick to snap‚Ä¶ always feeling lonely and kinda worthless lately..  I‚Äôve seemingly lost the joy and hope I had left.. hate to blame them but I have a very toxic relationship with my parents so it certainly doesn‚Äôt help, little to no friends (though I truly appreciate those I have).. but I‚Äôve just been so low lately.. only reason I‚Äôm sticking around is because of my child, who I love more than life itself. She needs me so I can‚Äôt go anywhere. (I‚Äôm in my mid 20s, Full time single dad). 

Anyways, thanks for listening and any feedback given.",286

 I‚Äôm going cold turkey on this because it ruins my life

Hello guys üëãüèª

effexor question,"Anyone know how to get off venflaxine or effexor without serious side effects?

Struggling with Effexor withdrawal,"I 19 AFAB was told by my psychiatrist to stop taking effexor after realizing it wasn't doing much for me and it was raising my blood pressure. I was prescribed Effexor where I used to live, and this was my first time seeing this psychiatrist after moving to the US. 

I was on the lowest dosage of the medication which is why she said it was okay to just stop taking it. This was on Thursday and today if I'm just still struggling with symptoms, albeit it's getting better. I'm just wondering if it's worth going to the hospital. Friday night I had horrible body tremors, and my heart was racing, nausea, brain zaps, fatigue, general feeling like shit, etc. Saturday the same except my heart rate seemed to be normal, but I had a migraine (not uncommon for me if I change anything in my lifestyle).

After a few days I started taking prozac, as that was a med that worked really well for me before, and she wanted to ease me back onto it with 10mg. I just wanted to know if anybody else has had a similar situation and how they dealt with this withdrawal + starting another drug at the sametime. I'm just so tired of feeling like shit",293
Withrawal from Effexor,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt worse in my life but I‚Äôm trying to come off on Venlafaxine/Effexor. Making food is making me nauseous and my jaw is hurting so bad that I‚Äôm chewing gum like I‚Äôve come off a 5 day bender. It‚Äôs been a week since I‚Äôve reduced the dose by 1/4 and today I took only half of it. The dose is small, only 37,5 mg now but the side effects are just awful. 
Does anyone have any advice with the headaches, nausea and jaw pain? Or if anyone can relate or something, I need some emotional support ü•≤",294
Weaning off effexor and experiencing nausea and throwing up :(,"I've been on effexor (150mg) since October or November, and a few months ago I was dumb and forgot to take my meds for a few days and experienced some *nasty* withdrawals. I'm a very forgetful person so I asked my psychiatrist if there was potentially a different medication we could switch to that had a longer half-life so that if my forgetful ass forgot to take my meds again I hopefully can avoid severe side effects. So, I'm currently starting on Trintillex and weaning off my Effexor. It's been going well except that I've been experiencing low grade nausea pretty much all hours of the day. It's not extreme, and only really causes me issues because it's been stifling my appetite. 

The other day after going to the gym and returning home to shower off, I randomly threw up, which is not like me at all. I chalked it up to not drinking enough water beforehand, but I've nearly thrown up a few times since then sans exercising beforehand, which makes me wonder if it's withdrawal symptoms instead of being something exercise-induced.

Switching Effexor to paroxetine,"Hi I‚Äôve been on Effexor 37.5mg for 1 year. I‚Äôve had horrible side effects and now my anxiety is getting worse to the point I‚Äôve been having more panic attacks, trouble leaving the house feeling very groggy on the meds.

I‚Äôve previously taken paroxetine for 4 years 20mg no dramas or side effects very effective for my anxiety and I would like to go back on it. 

My question is: can I stop taking Effexor today and commence the paroxetine tomorrow?

My bloods and ecg all normal. Also I‚Äôm on the lowest dose possible of the Effexor. 

If I start the paroxetine tomorrow is there any risk of serotonin syndrome? Considering they are such small dosages. 

Because yeh psychiatrist booked out for 2 months and GP was clueless. 

Can someone please help? 

Thanks",300
Quitting Effexor cold turkey,Back in September ‚Äò22 I was put on Effexor (venlafaxine) for depression and lamotrigine for bi polarism. Anyways long story short I quit the Effexor first weekend of February due to an ice storm and not being able to get a refill on my meds. Started 3 days with pretty severe withdrawals and figured. Fuck it. Kept on with the withdrawal system. It was horrific. But I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm still having effects of that medicine or not. Cause now I‚Äôm getting pretty depressive lows. And I don‚Äôt remember them being this bad. I‚Äôm not getting the mania so much anymore. But I also quit the lamotrigine. I‚Äôm just curious as to is this side effects of not weaning off the Effexor and if so how long will this last?? I feel as if I‚Äôm losing my freaking mind and it‚Äôs not just affecting me. It‚Äôs affecting my relationships.,301
EFFEXOR WITHDRAWAL,"
Hello, thank you for accepting me.
So, Ive been tappering of Efexor 150mg for about 1month now.
I was taking 75mg in the morning and 75mg in the evening, ext. Release version. Ive been on it for 9 months. 
My doctor recommended me to tapper of 1/4 of a dose every 4 days, so Id be off in less then a month. Since that felt completely insane to me, i started way more slow.
Im tappering by taking out the bids in the capsule, each capsule has 300 bids (so 600 in a day), and ive been taking 10 out from each capsule (so 290 and 290, and then 280 and 280, and then 270 and 270, ...etc) and staying on one dose for 7 days. So basically, 20 beads in 7 days. This is around 5% decrease a week. 
Ive been feeling like LIVING hell.
First week or so was okay, and then it has gotten worse and worse every day. I feel like im having constant, severe flu, body aches and pains, brain feels like its boiling every day, tension headaches, im tired 24/7 no matter how much I sleep. I sweat NON STOP and i feel feverish all the time. I also have vertigo, dizziness and weird brain feelings (had those before effexor too), but they are MUCH worse now. Ive tested for covid, since it feels like being extremely ill, always negative. Ive also had mood swings, pretty much every day. 

Can those things i feel still be from effexor, even if im going so slow?
If so, what can i do to help myself? I want to be off of this shit rather sooner than later but, should i go even slower? Is there anything that helps? Or this maybe isnt even withdrawal and its something else? 

Thank you so much.",302

Venlafaxine (Effexor etc) for the first time>,"What were your experiences in the early days of trying this?

I took my first one (75mg) on Thursday (idk if it counted fully as I was stupid, ignored instructions, took on empty stomach and was sick a lot but since then been keeping them down with food) and the last couple of days I've gone into total overdrive - my bedroom has been a total s\*\*thole for ages because of executive dysfunction, hoarding, various mental illnesses being fun etc. I'm resting now as worn self out for the moment but I've nearly finished clearing it and hoovering cobwebs and I can't even explain how big of a job it was, like 5 or so binliners full maybe closer to 10 especially as I haven't finished yet. Then I'm gonna clean it all. But I'm enjoying whatever this is. Idk if it's a case of new medication side effects or halfway into a long break from work and done nothing yet kicking in.

I also so far have loads of energy and not so much sleep (a plus for me as instead of sleeping for 24 hours out of depression, I stayed up for around 20 hrs yesterday and slept for maybe 6 and was awake.

Struggling with mental health & Effexor is making it worse,"So I‚Äôve been struggling with mental health constantly since a bad experience with weed in June. Went to a psychiatrist recently and was put on lexapro. The lexapro made me feel worse so I got my meds changed. This is day 3 on effexor. Day 1 was fine. Day 2 I took it and started to feel shitty after. The night of day 2 was the absolute worst. I felt like i was constantly shaking & my head went numb. I started having impulsive thoughts like crazy. I cleaned dishes that have been sitting for days. I ordered doordash & almost drank a lot of alcohol. Fast forward to today which is day 3. I took it again bc the pharmacist said you can‚Äôt just stop it. Symptoms were the same but less intense. Since I took i‚Äôve had a constant pressure in my head. Planning on making an appointment to address this but i feel hopeless.


Has this happened to anyone else?",306
Morning of Day 16: quitting 150mg Effexor XR COLD,"Wow. As I presumed, day fifteen was the hardest day. I collapsed from exhaustion just walking up my stairs in my home for almost two hours. Cried.

Took my first dose of venlafaxine/effexor (no side effects yet). Should I reconsider whether I take venlafaxine or stick with it?,"TLDR: Anxious about using venlafaxine after hearing the horror stories. Should I stop taking it after my first 37.5mg dose and talk to my psychiatrist, or just stick with it and try it out?

Hello all, I hope this is the right place to post this.

I saw a psychiatrist for the first time and they prescribed me 37.5mg of venlafaxine (generic effexor) for my depression and mild anxiety. I took my first dose about an hour ago, and while I feel alright, I am completely freaked out by the possible side effects and withdrawal symptoms. I am kicking myself for not researching the medicine more closely before taking it, and seriously considering just stopping for now and talking to my psych again. I have heard the success stories but I am very scared about all the horror stories. (I am also really forgetful and have a poor track record with keeping a sleep schedule so I am deathly afraid of missing some days)

1. Can I stop taking venlafaxine now with minimal withdrawal symptoms since it was just the one dose?
2. Am I overreacting to the venlafaxine horror stories? Or should I seriously consider not taking it?

I am getting worked up thinking about this stuff and think maybe I should have a more thorough discussion with my psychiatrist before I commit fully to venlafaxine. It seems that 25% of people swear by it and the other 75% wish they never took it in the first place (I know it is all relative).

Doc also prescribed me hydroxyzine to take only if I get some anxiety (or apparently nausea) so that has been a nice security blanket to have. I am also \~200lbs and 6' so perhaps the effects will be less severe to start with.

Thank you all in advance.",312

Poem about my experience on venlafaxine/effexor,"**I would love to know what some people thought of my poem if you feel so inclined :)**

**VENLAFAXINE**

My thoughts have been clouded, my emotions unsteady, and overall, I was in a state of denial

About all the serious side effects this drug has had on me now for a long while

Venlafaxine/Effexor whatever you want to call it

Has significantly impacted my thoughts, feelings, work, relationships, and has caused my moods to shift

I have desperately been doing (or so I thought) everything in my power that would allow these moods to lift

Many people have had short- and long-term positive effects with this medication

However, MY side effects have never fully ceased regardless of my level of consistency, support, and unwavering dedication

I thought there was something wrong with me and that I had some sort of flawed personality

Even though there was sometimes improvement- the painful symptoms would never decrease in totality

I allowed myself to be na√Øve and uninformed even when I had access to the facts

Doing enough consistent research on this drug is clearly an area of mine that significantly lacks

Now that I am transitioning off the drug, NOW I do my research and it makes so much sense to me

I am trying to forgive myself for it taking this long to realize and see what was right in front of me

End of story, it is a medication that helps with depression and anxiety is what I told myself

Any doubts I ever had were automatically brushed off and put far away on the shelf

Well, these previous doubts are now being removed off the shelf and brought back out

I now know the serious/life-changing effects this has had on me without a doubt

Here are some the side effects that I have had recently and in the not-so-distant past

¬∑ Tiredness

¬∑ Yawning

¬∑ Unusual dreams

¬∑ Tremor or shaking

¬∑ Dizziness

¬∑ Blurry vision

¬∑ Feeling anxious, nervous, and jittery

¬∑ Thoughts of dying

¬∑ New or worsened depression

¬∑ New or worsened panic attacks

¬∑ Agitation, restlessness, anger and/or irritability

¬∑ Serotonin Syndrome which has caused:

¬∑ Agitation

¬∑ Hallucinations

¬∑ Coordination problems

¬∑ Muscle twitches

¬∑ Racing thoughts

¬∑ Excessive happiness or irritability

¬∑ Talking more or faster than usual

¬∑ Seizures (not sure if it was in my case or not-they still haven‚Äôt been officially proven by catching them on a machine-just based on MY oral report to doctors based on OTHER PEOPLE‚ÄôS observations and assumptions to what it may be)

¬∑ Feeling unsteady

¬∑ Confusion

¬∑ Problems concentrating

¬∑ Thinking or memory problems

¬∑ Causing other medications that you are taking to be less effective

¬∑ Venlafaxine is also the drug MOST LIKELY to cause withdrawal symptoms while weaning off it such as:

¬∑ Extreme fatigue

¬∑ Flu-like symptoms like chills

¬∑ Brain fog

¬∑ And some or many of the previous symptoms that occur when you were taking your usual dose

¬∑ It may also cause ‚Äúbrain zaps‚Äù (I haven‚Äôt experienced those yet and hopefully will not in this process)

I am glad I now have this level of awareness despite how long it took

Trying so hard to forgive myself during this process of giving my health and life another careful look

I know this was all due to something medical that was beyond my control

But I am unable forget the impact it had on myself and others-a very painful and/or uncomfortable toll

I have never been the friend, acquaintance, colleague, or witnessing stranger of another person having an anxiety or panic attack right in front of me

I empathize with what a confusing and uncomfortable experience that must be

I know our country has made a lot of progress in accepting people who battle mental illness, but we still have so much further to go

The pain you feel, the confusion, and loneliness is a challenge that only the people who have experienced it truly know

Even then it is still on a spectrum-there is no one size fits all

Some people need therapy alone with no medication at all

While others need both during a life-long process of trying to heal

Some turn to alcohol, other drugs, overeating, and excessive spending-anything at all that will temporarily decrease how they feel

Even when you do ‚Äúwhat you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed to do‚Äù there are often new challenges to face

Making you lose hope that you may never get out of this place

I know my current self-doubt, anxiety, and daily concerns are being influenced by withdrawal symptoms from gradually stopping this medication

I still am trying to remain positive that when it is finally out of my system, I will be able to rejoice in utter celebration

I pray that the symptoms I have had (and many I am still going through) that I could not control will not have irreparable damaging affects to my relationships with the people that I have come to adore

Losing many or all the good relationships with the colleagues that I respect, my bosses, my good acquaintances, friends, and close friends would hurt me to the core

It would seem crazy and cruel not to forgive someone who had a heart attack, stroke, or another deadly disease but this is not what we are dealing with here

Mental illness is still controversial, it makes people uncomfortable-there continues to be that fear

I just want to be understood by some to any degree that they can

I want to be accepted as I strive through dedication and actions to be the healthiest and happiest person that I can

I understand and I accept that I am not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea

To some (or maybe many) I think too deeply, I‚Äôm too emotionally expressive, direct, sensitive, real, and complicated-those people want nothing to do with me

And that‚Äôs fine, I don‚Äôt need everyone to accept me-I just hope those I care for can value, respect, and hopefully even like and appreciate some or all my redeeming qualities

I am thoughtful, empathetic, reliable, and have a good sense of humor- I know others have these traits too and they are hardly ""me only"" anomalies

Support from caring people in your life that accept you is an important part of the healing process for those that can give to the degree that they can

I insist that this is a two-way street, I commit to giving to the ones I care for-I am dedicated to them too and making myself understand

I know some people with good intentions don‚Äôt know what to do or say-so it is more comfortable to do nothing

Reaching out, listening, accepting, spending time or anything else IS SOMETHING

And it helps and it matters so much to know some people truly care

To whatever degree and extent that they can be there

We all matter, and we all do better with loving, caring, and supportive people in our lives

As we go through the unknowns of this world-being our best self is what so many of us want and what are heart strives",317
Trazodone withdrawals ,"I started at 50mg 3 months ago. Took it for 2 months at 50mg and 1 month at 100mg and now she says just quit it without tapering because it's causing me nightmares.

Trazodone side effects?,"Trazodone side effects?

I (22F) have been diagnosed with OCD, ADHD and GAD a while ago. In august, I started experimenting awful panic attacks when going to sleep after a sleepless night. I started getting progressively worse intrusive thoughts about what would happen should I not be able to fall asleep. They quickly started to become really disruptive and I got prescribed Atarax to manage them. After a while, I noticed the medication was not helping at all and stopped taking it. This was about two months ago. To substitute that, I got prescribed Quetiapine (Seroquel) and Trittico(Trazodone). My psychiatrist told me I could just try them both on separate nights and see which would work best (I was supposed to take them as needed, so not necessarily every day). I took seroquel (25mgs) for a couple of days (about a week) and then, after talking to another doctor, I started taking Trazodone and took it every day for about a week and a half. Then I decided to take quetiapine for one night, nothing for the three nights after and then quetiapine again. The day after I started feeling really bad but I just thought it was the side effects of the seroquel, which were always pretty strong. It was in the evening that I realized that I maybe should have not switched my medications just like that and started taking trittico again. I‚Äôve been miserable since then: I feel like I used to when I was depressed (years ago), have been having really bad intrusive thoughts and crying multiple times a day. Is this because of the meds?

I‚Äôve been living with and battling this disease since I was 16 and I just want my life back.

Scary Intrusive thought and Panic attack possibly because Trazodone?,"Hello fellow Redditers,

I have a question. Lately I have been having some intense, unwanted, intrusive thoughts.
I've been Journaling and notice a trend that the days I have these ""manic"" episodes are usually the days after I use Trazodone to get to sleep. Today for instance, I got home from feeling terrible and on the fence of a panic attack all day, took a nap, and when I woke up I felt completely normal. I did some research and found that I had gone over the half life of Trazodone in that time. I've done some digging and found that mania and psychosis can be side effects of Trazodone... I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has some insight on this?? I don't think Trazodone is bad for everyone, but it seems like it is the cause of these issues for me.",322

But I've also been super stressed the past, like, year, so I'm not sure if it's just that.

Medication management worries,"Need some advice here.  
  
After a very bad past 2 months full of nervous breakdowns and panic attacks I've gone through multiple medications from my former psychiatrist. In the past month I've been on:  
  
50mg Sertraline (Up from my usual 7-year-standing 25mg)  
  
40mg Buspar  
  
20mg Propanolol (as needed)  
  
100mg Trazodone (night)  
  
25mg Seroquel (night)  
  
My sleep went from 2-4 hours to 6 which is not great, but was enough of an improvement. My anxiety however still persisted and keeps getting worse and it felt like nothing helped. My former psychiatrist felt like she couldn't help me and recommended I see a psychiatrist that specializes in anxiety and sleep, whom I met with yesterday.  
  
He recommended I get off the Sertraline & Buspar as they're not helping me and replace the Seroquel and Trazodone with Remeron (Mirtazapine). He wants me to slow taper the Sertraline to 25mg for a week and then stop. I explained to him that it's a lot of psych meds to be coming off of at once, and so quickly, and was very worried but he brushed it off saying I was on ""piddling"" doses and it shouldn't matter. He was very cold and distant, especially with how much visible anguish I came into the appointment with.  
  
Last night I took the Remeron with 50mg of Trazodone (I've read enough horror stories of trazodone withdrawal, I'm not going to cold turkey that one). I got tired but just couldn't fall asleep. Another hour later I took 25mg of Trazodone, a melatonin gummy, and finally when another 40 min passed, I caved and took a small amount (10mg) of Seroquel and finally was able to get a bit of sleep.  
  
  
  
I'm already in a very fragile mind state and feel so much anxiety I can barely eat or do anything. I'm very nervous to be changing up all my meds, whether they're working or not. Does anyone have any advice or experience in changing up their psych med regime in such a short time?",326
Time off work for withdrawal symptoms of SSRI? Help! ,"Hi everyone,

I (30F) have a history of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I‚Äôve been doing great for a good year or so, even got back into work doing a job I really enjoy and working from home (which suits me perfectly) since November. 

2/3 weeks ago, I spoke to my doctor because I had just started to pick up on a slightly lower mood than usual and diminishing motivation to do things I once enjoyed among other minor things that set off quiet alarm bells that things might be going south again if I didn‚Äôt keep an eye. In my eagerness to catch things early before they get really bad, I immediately spoke with my doctor and we settled on the idea of changing my antidepressants. I have been on sertraline (150mg) for about 6/7 years and trazodone for about 3/4 years (was previously on propranolol, but got changed to trazodone when, similarly, I felt they weren‚Äôt working for me anymore). 

We‚Äôve been tapering off, and I‚Äôm now on no trazodone whatsoever and about 3 days into venlafaxine, but still taking 50mg sertraline nightly. 

I‚Äôm exhausted. The only way I can describe it is that my body feels so heavy and I feel like I‚Äôm dragging it around. I‚Äôve never felt exhaustion like it. The other day we had a training session over teams for work and I legitimately almost fell asleep during it. Today I felt so exhausted sat at my desk that twice I had to just sit and cry because I just didn‚Äôt want to be fighting the exhaustion anymore. I am finding it more and more of a struggle because of the tiredness and zero energy. 

Oddly enough, mood wise I feel okay. Not great, but not bad by any means. The only thing that is pulling my mood down is how awful and exhausted I feel. I also have been getting headaches all day every day but that‚Äôs nothing in comparison. 

A big part of me wants to call the doctors and ask them to sign me off for a week or two because I‚Äôm finding it more and more of a struggle every day. I just want to lie down and rest so badly. I finish work and spend the rest of the evening asleep on the sofa until bedtime. God, I am so, so tired. 

I guess I want to know two things - is me asking for a week off because I‚Äôm so exhausted from withdrawals as pathetic as I feel like it is? And secondly, please someone give me some hope that this will pass soon because idk how much more I can take of being so freaking tired all the time. ",327
Any advice would be amazing,"So, here's the rundown. I was diagnosed with PTSD and Major Depression Disorder while in the military.

It has been a little over a month since I stopped taking Trazodone, but I still get this weird sensation every now and then that I'm going to wake up from a dream, or that I'll wake up and be in a mental institution or something like that. I'm thinking that it's just my brain still working on rewiring itself back to a normal state, but if anyone has ever dealt with something similar that has any advice it would be greatly appreciated. Usually I can lay down for half and hour and then get up feeling back to normal whenever this happens.",328
Serotonin syndrome is awful,"I recently had a scare with serotonin syndrome after my psych prescribed Trazodone to help me sleep through the night while I acclimate to Zoloft. 

As soon as I noticed my symptoms, I skipped Trazodone the next night, then skipped my morning Zoloft per my psychiatrist before going to the ER. All test results came back normal, but I was left feeling a lot of discomfort and anxious since I had skipped my Zoloft. 

After meeting with my psychiatrist the next day, we agreed to stop Trazodone and implement an alpha-blocker to help my sleep issues (I've been waking up wide awake in the middle of the night, unable to fall back asleep). I was already feeling better leading up to that appointment, so they gave me the OK to continue my Zoloft. Well, not 30mins after taking Zoloft did I start to feel symptoms again - not quite as severe as the day prior, but bad enough where I couldn't focus on work or even stand up from a sitting position without feeling weak as my heart rate spiked from 70bpm to 110bpm.  

I spent all day trying to take it easy, yet feeling like I was missing another day of my life this year trying to relax and not overdo things. My psychiatrist is having me stop Zoloft for a couple of days, then taper back on once things seem to normalize, but my conscious anxiety is telling me that Zoloft isn't going to work anymore, or that I should be afraid serotonin syndrome will happen again. 

I'm so bummed because I really think Zoloft was working for me, and now my progress is completely derailed...",329
anybody else?? ,"i‚Äôve had mental health issues for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôve taken SO many different meds to help alleviate my issues, such as: Zoloft, Buspirone, Lamotrigine, Depakote, Lexapro, Gabapentin, Abilify, Vraylar, Fluoxetine, Desvenlafaxine, Xanax, Wellbutrin, Latuda, Seroquel, Effexor, and Trazodone. 
I was diagnosed with Bipolar II back in 2019. then, last year my new psychiatrist said I was misdiagnosed with bipolar II and I actually have borderline personality disorder. 
I agree with having borderline personality disorder, but tbh I kinda disagree about not also having bipolar II. I genuinely exhibit SO MANY of the symptoms and high risk behaviors. I understand that the disorders are similar so maybe that‚Äôs why? idk.
I just want to know if anyone else has experienced the different diagnosis thing when speaking to a new psychiatrist? and if so, did you agree or not agree with them? ",330
Depression with extra features or Rapid Cycling BiPolar?,"About a year and a half ago, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and started taking Lexapro. However, I faced a tough time with insomnia for the next 3 months. Even with medication like trazodone and zaleplon added later, it was hard to fall asleep.

During this time, I noticed I cycled between extreme high and low moods every month. For about a week in the second week of each month, I stayed awake for up to 36 hours, then gradually returned to normal over the following week. After that, I'd start sleeping excessively, up to 18 hours a day, for the next few weeks, slowly building up to being awake again.

My psychiatrist suspected that Lexapro might be causing this due to a possible clash with bipolar disorder. So, I switched to Cymbalta, and over the last 6 months, my dosage has been gradually increased to 100 mg. These cycles have lessened in intensity, with me being awake for about 18 hours and then sleeping for 18 hours in a 2-week period.

I stopped taking zaleplon and trazodone because I felt they made my sleep worse. Now, I'm using 10 mg of prescription THC for sleep, which has been more helpful.

Although these cycles aren't affecting my life as much as before, they're still bothersome. I've got an upcoming appointment with a different psychiatrist to discuss it. My therapist and I think it might be due to normal hormone cycles, the SNRI medication I'm on, or an undiagnosed mood disorder.

I'm curious if anyone else has experienced these high and low cycles and found a solution? I'm wondering if adjusting my Cymbalta dosage or trying a different medication might help. What do you think?",331

Psychiatrists: can I take 300mg of bupropion with 20mg of fluoxetine? (Self-Medication) ,"I have a low energy problem, then my new psychiatrist changed my medication. I've changed my medication a lot of times on the last 2 years with my old psychiatrist, due to this low energy problem, and nothing helps me. Except for the Bupropion. When I told to my new psychiatrist this, she increased the Bupropion to 300mg, and she told me to stop Venlafaxine. So did I. However, now I remembered I haven't told her about my OCD. I emailed her, and she reduced again the Bupropion to 150mg and gave me Fluoxetine 20mg. I didn't liked that AT ALL. I'm so tired of this low energy, 2 years living with this, I swear to God. I told her ""isn't that keep the problem I have now?"" But she insisted on the 150mg Bupropion. So I'm thinking about doing something really stupid but which I think it's the only option: self-medication. I want to keep the Bupropion 300mg and to start Fluoxetine 20mg.

My depression and anxiety social anxiety are amplified and I have other symptoms now remember they lost fogginess headaches. I do see him mental health counselor. I called my primary because I could not get through to my mental health counselor about the medication and they are switching me to cymbalta. My relationships with my spouse and family are affected and it's something I wish I could fix. I want to be happy so bad. the solution for loved ones who aren't mentally ill tell me to just choose to be happy. I used to get drunk all the time on weekends and then just model through the week till the next drunk and that at least took away the sadness and anxiety a couple days of the week. but I cut way down on my drinking so now I want to get happy either with counseling and medication or just happy with life.,338
5 weeks on Bupropion where I'm at,"I'm now 5 full weeks into taking my daily 150 mg daily dose of bupropion for depression with no positive results. if anything i would say i am feeling worse. I'm depressed , and feeling negative thoughts pretty much all my waking hours.(i have no thoughts of harming myself or others )i had hoped the medication would be helping by this point and am now hoping i get results by the 6 to 8 week mark.
i dread obligations and responsibilities, no matter how minor. today I'm supposed to pick up my RV from the shop and don't feel like it, and don't feel like camping or doing any of the old hobbies i enjoyed. i love music but  familiar songs that once brought me joy now make me sad and melancholy, the same with old movies i used to love .it reminds me of that song that says what he likes because "" it doesn't remind him of anything"".. positive  familiar things should make me happy not sad.
 i am speaking with a mental health counselor at least every two weeks now and have a meeting with them and my primary DR this Thursday. i will discuss my medication not working at that point. 
 has anyone had experience with bupropion or another med actually taking 6 to 8 weeks before working?  did you have to add another med on top of the bupropion such as lexapro or buspiron? i had previously taken zoloft and had to wait about that long for good results but then after a period of time it stopped working and came off needs for 2 years until recently when i started sinking very low and realizing i made need medication again. 
i also have developed anxiety and social anxiety, which im not sure the bupropion will help with
 i don't necessarily want to keep adding other meds on top of my current one but at this point i will accept the recommendations of my health care advisors.
 I've taken Lexapro with success in the past but sweating and libido side effects steered me toward  Bupropion . 
 i want so badly to be happy, and will continue trying. I'm sitting here with my 2 year old grandson .. he's on his tablet when i feel like i should be playing outside or feeling the joy of interacting with him, or any other loved one.
 .i used to be a fairly heavy weekend binge drinking , probably using booze to self medicate. .
 I've cut down quite a bit on that and after reading the advice on not drinking on bupropion , i quit drinking the first 3 weeks on bupropion. i now drink maybe 2 to 4 beers maybe twice a week and and will gladly quit completely if this darned medication would start working and i thought the beer  was effecting the meds effectivness.

 i was switched to 30 mg duloxetine on July 3rd and have had some good results with it. my anxiety and depression are manageable on some days. i still have bad days but I'm hoping i continue to improve and can start finding joy in things again.

Anyone success with Wellbutrin (Bupropion) for Depression & Social Anxiety?,"I‚Äòve tried 13 meds now, all with very little (placebo like) to mostly no effects at all, mostly really zero, nada, except for side effects.

Gabapentin & Mirtazapine were the ones that had a subtle positive effect on depression and social anxiety.
Escitalopram had a huge effect but lasted only one week (why? Idk as all other SSRI/SNRIs had no effect at all)

Im trying to increasy my mood to more positive, be less anxious about the future, decrease my social anxiety (very important! As its the biggest source of my depression) and with this get more social, talkative and outgoing. I socially isolate myself very much and I think every human needs socializing to be happy (friends as well as romance).

"Lexapro, Wellbutrin, viibryd","
I started taking Lexapro at 10 mlg over a year ago. It gave me a bit of reprieve from anxiety and uplifted my mood. I did not have such intense mood flips throughout the day and overall was a positive. It did affect my libido however which in turn was affecting my relationship so a month ago my psychiatrist prescribed Wellbutrin. The past month has been rough. My anxiety peaked through the roof. Ive felt extremely irritable, almost rage at the slightest thing. My mood shifts throughout the day have been akin to when I‚Äôm not on meds and in general I‚Äôve felt much more emotionally sensitive. My psychiatrist suggested I try viibryd, as it‚Äôs similar to Lexapro with a much lower risk of libido side affects.
The crazy thing is even though Wellbutrin has made me feel awful the majority of the month the extra energy it gives me and the level of focus/clarity makes me not want to put it down. I‚Äôm realizing that Lexapro may of been making me feel slightly numb. I feel like I‚Äôm feeling again. This past week of taking it has been a bit better, but the added anxiety and irritation is still present. I don‚Äôt know much about viibryd. The process of medication change is exhausting and I‚Äôm hesitant to try it.

Switching to Wellbutrin. My last attempt at getting better.,"Greetings.

I was diagnosed with MDD, GAD and ADHD (#alphabet gang). I started off on Effexor, my success with it was short lived. I felt numb and nonchalant. It took away all my fighting spirit but I was less inclined to drive under a truck. Until I wasn't. 

Then I switch to lexapro. I gave it a solid 4 months. I can't tell if it worked or not. The depression was better but I was more nonchalant than ever. I struggle with basic adulting. I've always kind of struggled but I was able to still kick ass at my job and other things that mattered. 

Now, I suck at my job, I suck at adulting and even the threat of being unemployed, unfit and unhealthy isn't getting me off my bum. I concluded that the antidepressants are making me this way. They took away the anxiety of being a loser bum. Now I'm a loser bum. 

My psychiatrist kindly advised against going off completely. Now I'm starting wellbutrin 150, with methylphenidate 27. All while I'm tappering off the lexapro. 

Any advice for someone switching? Has anyone quit antidepressants all together and actually got better? Should I pencil in an exorcism or lobotomy? Is unemployment and poor hygiene that bad of a thing? Don't answer the last one, even I know that's not an option. ",354

Zoloft support with Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôve been rolling down the rabbit hole of reading other threads and I wondered if maybe my experience might be helpful for some. I have been on Zoloft 100mg for 8 years now and have managed with anxiety episodes periodically happening that debilitate me for a week and then I take my prescribed klonopin and can resume life. (Note I do not like how klonopin makes me feel AT ALL). 

This most recent anxiety spell (triggered by PTSD) left me feeling rocked and hopeless. I finally agreed to do something different with my medication. I would like to note I have generalized anxiety disorder, depression, panic disorder and ptsd. I don‚Äôt have access to a psychiatrist because I am on an 8month waiting list but have been working with my doctor and therapist. 

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been doing. 1. I switched from klonopin to ativan - so. Much. Better. It takes the anxiety away and then I can function again. I take the lowest dose and have only had to use it 8 times over the past month. 

2. Originally we started on seroquel 25mg. The first day I took this medication I slept 15 hours. It was wild. It took about 3 days for my intrusive thoughts of self harm to dissipate but they did. Unfortunately this medication  left me feeling numb until about 4pm everyday - like I lost my sparkle. When I couldn‚Äôt preform at my job I spoke to my therapist about cutting the pill in half (not even considered a medical dose‚Ä¶). This was helpful. I could function better sooner in the day but I still didn‚Äôt like how it made me apathetic and slow. It did 100% remove my intrusive thoughts and make me sleep like a baby! 

3. After 5 days of 12.5mg of seroquil (10 days total on the drug) my doctor decided we should try something else. Which I appreciated because I work with kids and need my full speed thoughts to help me help them ahah. Doctor perscribed Wellbutrin XL 150mg. Yesterday was the first day I took and and I felt like I was hyper focused and could do anything, but also a little high. My high rate was higher but I did not experience anxiety. Towards to the of the day I got a pretty splitting headache and went down the ‚Äúwhat if I never find something that works for me‚Äù rabbit hole and ended up needing to take Ativan. I did fall asleep around 10:30 and woke up at 6. This morning I was planning on going away and doing something that fires up my anxiety. I ended up again needing Ativan (not common for me to take them multiple days in a row). I decided to miss this one night away and stay home, subsequently I took my Wellbutrin at 10am instead of 7am because of my morning fiasco. It‚Äôs half way through the day now and I do not feel anxiety and was actually able to take a nap. I don‚Äôt fell depressive thought barging in either. I do have a slight headache but in general I‚Äôm just feeling content. 

I‚Äôm going to keep updating this thread in case this helps someone.

I have serious medication anxiety personally so maybe this will help someone else too.",358
Wellbutrin and anxiety?,"I've been on Wellbutrin for about two months now. Overall it's been amazing. Starting it has been a night and day difference. I feel happier, not irritated anymore. I'm able to focus better and I don't get as overwhelmed with my to-do lists. I'm also losing weight which has helped my confidence. It's basically improving most of my prior mental health concerns. 

However, the past few days my anxiety has been kinda high. Which is abnormal for me. I'm not sure if it's due to the lack of sleep. On average I get about 3-5 hours of sleep. I tend to sleep in on my days off work so that kinda makes up for it. 

But here lately I've been dealing with back pain along with the lack of sleep, getting dental work done and just general life stressers. 

When the back pain got really bad my mind jumped to the thought of becoming paralyzed, then permanently disabled, then financial ruin. None of which is really logical. 

Has anyone experienced an increase in anxiety after being on Wellbutrin? If so do you have ideas on how to make it better? Any recommendations for managing the anxiety? 
Do I just wait and see if it passes like I did with other side effects? 

My main concern with this is leaning on my partner. They are super supportive and will listen and try to help as much as they can, but they also deal with their own stuff, so I feel it's unfair to them and frankly it's annoying for me to deal with so I presume it is for them as well. They are great at reassuring me. But I imagine it gets old after a while. I know it does for me anyway.

I just hate feeling like an anxious mess over stuff I know isn't logical.

There is a slight change cause I can actually eat now but I feel really off and need some advice for those that suffer like me and here are all the things I've been feeling.
1. Nausea that can last all day or sometimes just half the day.
2. Feels like head is gonna explode or just pass out or faint from the weird built up head sensation.
3. I get Nausea and anxious about anything I do whether it just be take a shower or even brushing my teeth.
4. Things dont visually look the same to me anymore, like im in a place that is weird to me and feels off.
5. I get visual problems like blurry vision, can't concentrate or things feel like they are spinning.
6. I can't comprehend what people are saying sometimes and sometimes I say things and either forgot what I said or just can't think of a word to say back.
7. sleeping is an issue that I've been having lately, feels like I didn't sleep at all even though I did or just can't sleep and have to take a trazadone to try and help.
8. Very sad, like I have suicidal thoughts but would not act on them but they are scary.

These are everyday things I deal with and its so hard and draining cause I'm afraid ill never be my normal self again! I have had blood work done and thats as far as it goes cause they shrug me off and say its anxiety and it just might be but I don't know that! What if something is truly wrong with my brain and I actually will never be the same and live a life where I can go and enjoy things. Please help or at least make me feel no so alone in all this.",361
"Have you ever taken Wellbutrin and gotten a really high sex drive because of it, how did you handle it?","I'm currently taking Wellbutrin and have noticed a significant increase in my sex drive since starting the medication. It's been a bit overwhelming, and I'm not sure how to manage it. Have any of you experienced this side effect? If so, how did you cope with it? Did it level out over time, or did you need to make any changes to your dosage or medication? Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",362

I‚Äôve also read you must taper. Certainly I will consult my doctor but, my appointment is a long ways out. In the interim im interested to know, have any of you gone from taking an anti depressants to Straterra than stopped Straterra abruptly? Experiences? Im extremely nervous to stop cold turkey as I‚Äôve foolishly done before with even the smallest doses of anti depressants and suffered immensely. That said, the side effects im suffering from Straterra are just terrible! I know one must always pay the piper and be patient when it  comes to anti depressants.

Wellbutrin and Anxiety,"Has anyone else had a similar experience...? I was prescribed Wellbutrin 150 mg in July of this year; didn't really notice that it helped anything for a while tbh. In September I started having a lot of random anxiety symptoms - heart palpitations, chest pains, just rapid heart rate and constantly aware of my heart beat. Crying spells too. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder in the past and used to be on Prozac, but these physical symptoms I have never really experienced before. I always used to have more of the psychological symptoms of anxiety like worrying, never the physiological symptoms. I am wondering if this is caused by the Wellbutrin because I know that is a common side effect, but is it weird that the anxiety started a couple months after starting the Wellbutrin? I would think the anxiety would have started earlier if these are correlated. ugh. just want to get to the bottom of this.",365

Severe depression one week after starting Wellbutrin,"As a teenager, I got off all my meds because they always made me feel numb and usually worse than before. I haven‚Äôt been on any mental health meds ever since.

I decided to quit vaping after being addicted to nicotine for 10+ years. My doctor said he usually prescribed wellbutrin with nicotine patches as it helps decrease cravings. I said well, I‚Äôll try it since I‚Äôm an adult now and maybe I‚Äôll react differently.

I was on it for 7 days before I started getting cripplingly depressed. For two days I thought I was on the edge of ending my life out of nowhere. I blamed it on quitting nicotine, but at this point I was literally almost two weeks in and had very few cravings. My family started getting concerned that I was having an adverse reaction to the medication. I truly felt out of my head, no control over my thoughts. I haven‚Äôt taken it today and so far I feel fine.

I took Wellbutrin XL 150mg once in the morning for the past 2 months and I‚Äôve done okay. I became more irritated and my suicidal ideations got really bad (which is odd for me, because I don‚Äôt often struggle with this). After expressing this to my dr she wants to up my dose to 300mg. 

I haven‚Äôt done it yet because 1) I‚Äôm terrified the agitation and suicidal thoughts will get worse. 2) I‚Äôm absolutely terrified if I increase my dose I will have a seizure. For those of you who increased your dose from 150 to 300 did you get any new side effects?",369

I quit because it didn't seem to help my depression, anxiety, or ADHD, but I did gain 50 pounds give or take 10 while I was on it. Will my weight go back down? I spent most of my life being self conscious of being too skinny. In the last six years I've learned to enjoy it and love that about myself. I considered my face to be one of my better attributes. Now I weigh almost 200 lb and my face is kind of chubby. Not fat yet, but you can't see my jaw line. I really want that jawline back and to be skinny again. Not unhealthily skinny, but the way I learned to love myself. It seems like some kind of cruel joke for life to turn around and say, just kidding now you have to learn to love yourself being chubby, or at least disproportionately fat in some areas.

"What next: Escitalopram, Sertraline or Amitriptyline? None?","So, my psychiatrist once suggested Escitalopram as my depressions were at the worst. However, I Pregabalin was given to me against (nerve) pain but the Pregabalin made me, I believe, even more suicidal and highly agitated. It did help against the pain though.

It's a rather complicated story with my health which started three years ago. A year ago, after one week of Mirtazapine I got excrutiating pain in my limbs and vein issues. After that I got Pregabalin. I believe this had a connection to Covid actually and was not the Mirtazapine on its own.

Now, my pain subsided in the last weeks but my depression is still present. I wanted to discuss with my psychiatrist what to try and if I should at all. Escitalopram, Sertraline and Amitriptyline were on my mind.

I do fear negative (permanent) side effects from them though (there is this PSSD syndrome I heard of) looking back at my Mirtazapine reaction. Any suggestions or thoughts would be highly welcomed. I believe I don't have the mental capacity for good decision making for this right now.",375

Vivid dreams on anti anxiety meds?,"Hey guys.

Additionally, my happiness appears to be entirely dependent on the availability of my friends. If they are not available, I get intensely irrationally angry and it sucks the life out of me to pretend i am not.

I have attempted to seek help before, each time unable to point out exactly what i need help with. The first time (March 2023) i met with a family doctor, i was only able to tell her i was experiencing low moods and therefore recurring suicidal thoughts. The second time, it was anxiety about attending school which i did not feel accurately reflected my state of mind, although i did have recurring suicidal thoughts as well. For reference, i‚Äôve been prescribed amitriptyline and lexotan respectively, as well as seen a therapist for a few sessions. I have not been diagnosed with anything. It is extremely difficult for me to articulate my emotions. As a result, i have tried journaling, but i fail to see any recurring pattern of thought (over an extended period of time except for the suicidal thoughts) that might lead to a possible root of cause.

Psychosomatic symptoms in the form of chronic tension-type headaches (anyone else out there?),"Hi!

I am a 35 year-old male. I have been perfectly healthy and normal up until 2012-2013, when I burned myself out really badly. As I didn't listen to my body, it generated this insane tension-type headache (TTH), and only then was I forced to stop. So, the TTHs had a purpose initally: to stop me. 

Unfortunately, my tension-type headache got chronic and I have been suffering from it ever since 2012-2013 on a daily basis. Now it does not have a proper function but as it was activated 10 years ago it just did never go away. Now, it is just disabling me as it is triggered by any stress or fear. As a result I am on disability pension and my life is extremely limited. 

My TTH feels like a tight band is squeezing my head, which is just horrible. In addition, I usually also get irritated and noise-sensitive. I have been taking amitriptyline since 2019 as a preventive medication. It was very helpful in the beggining, but later the headaches were not prevented by amitriptyline that well. The initial dose was 100 mg per day. We increased the dose to 225 mg recently, and now the TTHs aren't as bad as before. I am just afraid that with time the TTHs will get worse again. 

Other medication: 80mg propral, 25mg ketipinor, 45mg Mirtazapin, lorazepam 0-3mg per day. 

Since the TTHs can be triggered by any stress or fear, there has developed a lot of weird triggers for the TTH. For instance, in May 2022 I was outdoors and I got a TTH. I was so convinced that I got the TTH because I was outdoors that after that every time I have tried to go outside I get scared of the TTH and consequently I get the TTH (=conditioning, which reinforces itself every time I get the TTH), unless I take lorazepam which works well in a preventive way and blocks the development of the TTH. However, I cannot take lorazepams every day so my life is really limited and there are days when I am forced to just be home, mostly lying on the floor. I take 2-3 mg lorazepams preventively at the moment, so that I have some ability to function, since the TTHs just disable me totally. 

Another example is using public transport. I had a bad experience in May 2021 where I got TTH in a bus and after that I have been afraid to use public transport since I fear the TTH. As a result, every time I have tried to use public transport without sedatives I have gotten the TTH and I am even more scared the next time I try it. 

My main problem is that fear of TTH actually generate these TTHs, and the vicious cycle is ready.

Are there any other people with a similar psychosomatic symptoms and have you been able to get rid of the TTHs? I am sure I am not the only one in the world suffering from this specific psychosomatic symptom.",384
Switching antidepressants,"Hi everyone!!

I started to use venlafaxine (150 mg) on December/2020 due to a major depressive episode. After a few months I started to feel pretty good and soon I was able to be functional again: Found a new job, get out of the house, etc. But since March/2022 I was feeling blue again and my psychiatrist decided to switch my medication to amitriptyline. Of course this was a progressive change, and now I'm done with venlafaxine and started amitriptyline on 12.5 mg, but soon it will be 25 mg.

I don't know why, but I have some symptoms of abstinence even though I switched the medication just as the doctor said. I feel dizzy most of the time, I have trouble sleeping, and tremors. I'ts been 2 weeks now.

So I want to ask you guys if you experienced those kind of symptons while switching medication. Is it normal? I don't want to talk about this to my doctor yet because I may be overreacting.

Which med helped you being more sociable/talkative?,"I suffer from depression and social anxiety since I can think. Diagnosed since I was 15. I already tried many different meds as well as therapies but still nothing was able to get my symptoms into control or make me functional. 

Social anxiety is the biggest issue as it‚Äòs additionally the main cause of my depression. 

Just thinking about the next days or years makes me depressed because of the thoughts how to get through that social event, that chat with a friend, that meeting, that career path, that romantic relationship and so on because EVERYTHING has socializing in it. 

Socializing affects every aspect of life. My brain chemistry hinders me in every aspect of socializing making me very restricted. Being aware of these restrictions in every aspect of life (career, love life, friendships, sports, hobbies, passions etc.) makes me very depressed. Depression again feeds the social anxiety by zero energy, motivation, drive, anhedonia and so on.

What meds helped you the most with being better in socializing and also having more fun and drive to do so? 

Please be aware that I already tried following ones:
- 2 analytical depth psychological therapies
- 1 cognitive behavioral therapy
- SSRI/SNRIs: Escitalopram, Venlafaxine, Sertraline, Paroxetine, Duloxetine
- DNRI: Bupropion
- Neuroleptics: Promethazine, Quetiapine
- Tricyclic: Amitriptyline
- MAOI: Moclobemide
- Benzos: Diazepam, Lorazepam
- Gabapentinoids: Gabapentin, Pregabalin
- Others: Mirtazapine, Opipramol, Hydroxyzine

All were without any success in symptoms. Except for Pregabalin. But it‚Äòs still not helping 100% or making life bearable - aside I don‚Äòt think you can use that daily anyways.

Would love to read about your experiences and success with meds for sociability when suffering from depression and social anxiety or any other conditions.

My treatment for Anxiety and Depression.,"Hello friends, 
    I am suffering from anxiety and depression, specifically Hypochondriasis, for last 4-5 years. I started treatment 5 months ago. The meds did reduce my hypochondriasis but my general anxiety hasn't been  reduced significantly yet. Medicines also make me sleepy, drowsy and out of energy many times. I am currently on the following drugs- Sertraline 50mg, Amitriptyline 25mg, Vortioxetine 10mg, Risperidone 1mg, Clonazepam 0.5mg. I can't sleep early at night due to irrational fears of robbery, my house catching fire, my father falling down while visiting bathroom (as he is heavy alcoholic) etc. 
  I am an introvert and perhaps, I have social anxiety too.
   I feel lonely and suicidal frequently. I love my parents so much and they too love me so much, I am being their adopted son. I just wished to share my feelings here. It would be greatly comforting for me if someone share their thoughts on this. Thank you so much friends.",388
How to live with suicidal thoughts?,"21M, been depressed for 3 years and having pretty much constant suicidal thoughts since the beginning of this year.

Even though I really want to kill myself, and have spent a lot of time planning, acquiring means, even called the hotlines when I really thought I was going to take my life one night- I haven't managed to go through with it. I'm just too scared of the pain and start having second thoughts at the last minute- particularly about my loved ones (not about my own life- I feel no attachment to it- but I don't want to fuck up anyone else's).

The problem is, I've tried therapy for 3 years and it hasn't helped. I've tried fluvoxamine and it didn't help, now on amitriptyline but I'm inconsistent with taking it cause the brain fog side effect knocks me around so much. I'm not convinced these thoughts are going anywhere because I've got no desire to improve my life (because at the deepest level I want to be dead) and nothing anyone says, and nothing I read, seems to give me any reprieve at all. 

On top of that I have some hard times coming up in the next few months, I'm running out of money so I need a new job after quitting my old one in January, and I'm more than halfway to uni exams but I've only done about an hour of uni work all year (I'm basically checked out mentally).

So I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for living with suicidal thoughts? I've heard stories of people just being stuck with these thoughts for years or decades, but I don't understand how they do it. It's unbearable and makes it so hard just to talk to anyone, get a job, literally earn enough to stay alive.

Cheers, much love to you all",389

Help needed please,"I‚Äôve been on this med for 9 weeks and was in a bad place prior but now even worse!

Antidepressants vs antipsychotics,"My psych wants to prescribe me either quetiapine or amitryptaline. He says that people like me who have reacted very poorly to antidepressants, have GI issues anxiety/ ptsd have taken to this med the best. But he wants me to try the antipsychotic first because of how poorly I‚Äôve reacted to antidepressants in the past. I don‚Äôt know what to do, everyone is saying antipsychotics are worse but I want to die on every antidepressant I‚Äôve ever tried they‚Äôre literally torture for me. I feel so stuck. Also tried a BILLION things for sleep (and had a sleep study) so I just want to keep the discussion on antipsychotics and antidepressants. 

 I‚Äôve been struggling intensely for about a year and a half with severe anxiety and ptsd. I can‚Äôt sleep at night. I get 1-4 hrs. Most times 2-3. The sleep has been a BIG issue. I hate my life and it makes it hard to function. Lots of nightmares. They‚Äôre horrible. I‚Äôll wake up panicked.I‚Äôve tried a lot of different antidepressants but I‚Äôve reacted horribly to all of them even at their lowest doses. Extreme anxiety, dissociation, constant panic attacks. And I still have long term effects (tinnitus). The last one I tried, mirtazapine, was fine at first and then I started dissociating constantly the next week 24/7 (it was so scary), had extreme stomach pain (felt like it was on fire, I also have ibs for context). And I always felt on the verge of a panic attack. And then I‚Äôd panic. I felt like I was dying. My psych has me on clonazepam and clonidine and I‚Äôll also take some hydroxyzine at night but I know clonazepam is not a long term solution. These meds have helped a bit with the anxiety though and the nightmares. But I tell people I‚Äôm taking a benzo and they act like I‚Äôm gonna die because of it. I literally wouldn‚Äôt be here without it because nothing else was working they were making me worse! But I really want to find something, especially so I can wean off the benzo but I‚Äôm just so scared of trying new meds. Especially antidepressants :(",396

"Looking for a new Psychiatrist. Should I ask my general practitioner for a referral, or just look for one myself?","Hello. My old psychiatrist left the organization where I was getting my pysch appointments from. It's called NOAH, and is basically meant for people with low income. I've gotten Medicaid insurance though, so I'm not sure I need to go through this NOAH organization anymore. Initially, I didn't have Medicaid/ACHHS, so do I still need to have my psychiatry stuff be handled by them, now that I am on Medicaid?  


So if I stay with NOAH, I could call them and try to find a new psych. Or I could look for a psychiatrist online and try to do it that way. Or I could ask for a referral from my doctor. Also, all my psych appointments have been virtual, does that matter? Should I look for in-person appointments?  


I have gotten a new psych from NOAH, so I do have one. I just am liking her less and less with each appointment. Initially I thought she was just blunt, which is generally a good thing with doctors, but now I just feel she is unhelpful. I am taking Bupropion XL, once a day. I asked her if maybe there'd be a difference if I took Bupropion that wasn't Extended Release, and she just sort of shut it down. I also asked her if I should raise my Bupropion, to see if it would help with my energy levels, and feeling somewhat low lately. She said no, because a higher dose of Bupropion gave me more anxiety in the past, but this was when I took the Bupropion by itself, not alongside Amitriptyline, as I'm doing right now. I told her this, and she didn't seem to think it mattered. In general, when I ask her a question or ask for her thoughts about medication issues, she just says, ""Well you have to just take the medication, then we'll see how you feel."" But I feel that she, as a psychiatrist, should help me understand moreso what may happen when I take these meds. Right now, it just seems that she basically always tells me, ""Just take it and see what happens.""  


I'm not sure if I'm being unreasonable here, but the other psychiatrists I've had in the past felt more helpful to me. My new psych just seems deliberately obtuse or unhelpful or something. What do you guys think? Am I expecting too much?",398

Do I really need to go to a partial hospitalization program?,"3 years ago I had a bad ‚Äútrip‚Äù on weed and it triggered intense feelings of derealization for me. Since then, I‚Äôve been having extremely short (literally like 2 seconds) but almost daily episodes of feeling that derealization feeling. Nowadays it‚Äôs worst when I‚Äôm trying to sleep - I‚Äôll experience it really intensely and snap awake before trying to sleep again. The feeling that my surroundings, memories, or even myself aren‚Äôt real causes me to panic and I‚Äôm frequently tense worrying that it‚Äôll happen again. I‚Äôve been prescribed a ton of meds throughout the past 3 years, including Abilify for a few months and an entire year of taking Klonopin. Currently I‚Äôm just taking Buspar and Elavil. I‚Äôve been to 3 different counselors since this all started. The Klonopin did help, but I don‚Äôt want to go back on it because of its dependency-causing nature. My current counselor suggested I get assessed by a nearby mental hospital to see what they think I should do moving forward. Earlier today I got assessed and they recommended a PHP. I was surprised because that seems even more intense than an IOP. Fortunately, the PHP is 100% covered by my insurance if I do decide to go.
tldr: is derealization a worthy reason to do a partial hospitalization program?",405
"Am I lazy, crazy or just burnt out?","**Issue:**  
I'm going through something that I haven't experienced before, not as intense as this anyway. For about three weeks I have not been able to do anything productive at all at work. I work as a Copywriter. My job is 100% remote and I only work 20 hours/week. I have to work remotely since I have chronic gastritis with 24/7 nausea.

I have always been a peson with a high work ethic and moral, and been able to push through no matter what. This time it's different, I feel melancholic and indifferent. Loosing this job would put me in a difficult situation economically, but still I just can't seem to get myself together and do the work. 

**Symptoms:**  
Despite really trying to read into a topic or write a ""first shitty draft"", it feels as if there's a wall inside my head that I can't get through. I had two better days last week, but I could still only stay productive for 1-2 hours before my brain shut down again. It feels a bit like when I'm out jogging and run out of breath. I also forget words, walk into a room forgetting what I was supposed to do, forget meetings. I'm either hyped, fatigued or numb. A small notification from an email or chat message might as well be a truck crashing into me. 

I'm still able to focus on things that I enjoy doing, like painting, cleaning or playing video games. Last time I felt like this was in November last year, before I went from working full time to part time. Melancholy is not a new thing in my life, but this level of numbness is starting to scare me a bit. 

**Medical:**  
I live in a very small city (Europe) so public healthcare is free, but shitty. I don't want to contact the health center anymore since they're straight up rude on the phone. Last time I tried they didn't have any appointments available at all. I'm on 37,5 mg Venlafaxine since December 2021 (Effexor, for GAD) and 25 mg Amitriptyline since early 2021 (Elavil, for gastritis/IBS), however don't feel the effects of them anymore.

**TW:**>!For the first time in 2 years I've felt the urge to self harm (not acted on it) and I have suicidal ideation. I have disordered eating habits that I keep falling in and out of. The nausea and occasional vomiting is making my bad relationship with food worse.!<

I have a great support system with caring family and friends, not experienced significant trauma, no substance abuse (yes, despite my beautiful username, it's illegal here) and I have undergone brief CBT for GAD. The doctors usually don't take me seriously because I'm a normal weight late 20's woman who doesn't look sick.

**Just venting:**  
I know this sounds clich√© and cringy but how do people endure this capitalistic society? I also know I should be happy having a job, a wholesome and healthy family, free health care, my own apartment, a dog etc. Still I'm in this dark place unable (and maybe even unwilling) to find my way back up. I keep self diagnosing myself with all kinds of disorders and syndromes to find some form of explanation to why I feel like this. The only ""real"" diagnosis I have is GAD. 

I'm a perfectionist and I want to excel at everything, so of course I even excelled at therapy. By wearing my perfection-mask and saying things I thought the therapist wanted me to say. 

Anyway. Thanks for letting me vent. Feel free to respond if you have any similar experiences, can relate, want to share something or ask questions.

Positive stories coming off clomipramine / anti depressants for OCD?,"Hi all, looking for some positive stories about coming off clomipramine / antidepressants for OCD?

> was on Effexor for 6 years, was able to come off and unmedicated for 2 years 
> experienced intense anxiety/depression during that time 
> went on Prozac for 2 years but still had a lot of anxiety 
> diagnosed with OCD last year (30 years old) and changed medication to clomipramine
> had to flush Prozac out of my system so went from 40mg, to 20mg to 0.

I couldn't take Clomipramine for 3 weeks because of insurance issues. Can I start taking the dose again that I was taking before I stopped?,"Hi! I haven't been taking Clomipramine for about 3 weeks now. I was on 150mg, or 75mg twice daily. 

It really helped a ton with anxiety. Not only that, it gave me a personality. Instead of dissociating in social situations it helped me be confident, and be able to say what I personally think I should say. 

All that is gone now. A ton of OCD and SAD. 

I had some insurance issues at the moment so I stopped taking it. I finally got the medication back, and was hoping to get right back on the dose I left on.

What medication next? Details provided. Please help!,"I present with OCD and Depression. Symptoms include; anhedonia, lack of motivation, mood instability - highs and lows (often), lack of self worth & desire to change things, not being able to get up in the mornings, get out of bed & sleeping too long, and anxiety (OCD). 

Past medication: Fluoxetine (Prozac), Sertraline (Zoloft), Escitalopram (Celexa), Paroxetine (Paxil), Venlafaxine (Effexor), Clomipramine (Anafranil), Buproprion (Wellbutrin), Buproprion & Fluoxetine, Modafinil [very short term] & Fluoxetine, Vortioxetine (Trintillex), Moclobemide & Aripiprazole (Abilify) & Clonazepam (Klonopin). 

I know that the likely suggestion will be an MAOI. However, it is extremely difficult to convince an NHS Psychiatrist in the UK, let alone a Private one, to prescribe an Irreversible MAOI. Also, they might be the best antidepressant of a bad bunch, but they do have quite strong side effects and, after experiencing this with Moclobemide, short half-life antidepressants that you have to take several times a day have always been an issue for me as I forget or don‚Äôt take them at the same time every day.

I‚Äôm so sick and tired of feeling no pleasure in anything, not having the motivation to live life, no desire to socialise & form connections, going to sleep late and waking up late. 

I just want to live life, but there‚Äôs something in my brain that just prevents me from doing this. I‚Äôm so jealous of friends, and people out there, who are active and constantly doing things. 

I want to stop Duloxetine, but I don‚Äôt even know what to try next in an attempt that this will FINALLY help‚Ä¶.",430
Medication and side effects,"I started being medicated for my depression in 2017. As years went by there were a lot of adjusts to my meds, and I even changed psychologists and psychiatrists once or twice until I found the right ones. In 2021/2022 (can't remember the exact year) I was also diagnosed with bpd. I then started being medicated for both. And, obviously, continued going to therapy.

I take 5 meds in total every day, and I have and I still am experiencing many side effects: no libido and feeling no pleasure, shaking a lot mainly my hands, sweating a lot mainly my face, gained around 30kg and, the latest, having trouble peeing, I bet I've experienced even more effects but just didn't notice.

The meds are supposed to help me deal with my lack of mental health, although they barely do it, but they're getting me physically ill and depressed over it.

If I keep having trouble peeing I will have to be trained to apply an algalia on myself every 3 hours to pee thru it. Like wtf? I got out of the urologists office crying because not only am I feeling down due to having this many side effects, but also feeling down that I will have to put a fucking tube up my uretra to be able to pee. I am not 70 yo, I'm 23! As if I wasn't already frustrated for being overweight, feeling no pleasure, shaking and sweating a lot...

Edit: I don't know how ""algalia"" is called in english, sorry. Also, this are the meds I'm currently taking: bupropion, venlafaxine, reagila, anafranil, morfex",431
What's inpatient treatment really like? Is it as bad as people make it sound? Does this sound like the kind of thing you'd go in for?,"I'm having some kind of messed up nervous breakdown after dealing with severe and worsening OCD for years.

I am going to my psychiatrist with my boyfriend next Thursday to discuss further treatment options. I think this is the next step for me, based on the way the symptoms are swallowing my life. Years of therapy/medication has also failed to alleviate the worst of the symptoms.

Lately I spend all day agitated and upset and nervous. I have a thousand thought chains relating to death and illness all day long. I can't sleep. I have no desire to do anything and I'm so nervous I've lost 10 pounds in the last few weeks. I threw up every day for a week when this first started. I went to the emergency room. My psychiatrist put me on anafranil directly after and it did nothing.

Is that something they could help me with in an inpatient psychiatric treatment facility? I have had my current psychiatrist for years (He's 1 of 2 I've had) and the meds I'm on have made a lot of improvements in my functioning, however treatment hasn't touched the horrible thoughts, the looming dread, the mood swings, the lack of motivation, and the derealizing/dissociation. I don't do anything I enjoy anymore because there's no point to it.

Would appreciate any insight on the situation :') HMU if you need more detail",432
Who else has gone back a medication they‚Äôve been on before?,"So I have been on; Fluoxetine (Prozac), Escitalopram (Lexapro), Sertraline (Zoloft), Venlafaxine (Effexor), Vortioxetine (Trintillex), Bupropion on its own and augmentation with Fluoxetine, Clomipramine (Anafranil) Modafinil (Provigil), and Moclobemide augmentation with Aripiprazole (Abilify). 

I‚Äôm working out what I want to try next. It‚Äôs extremely difficult to get prescribed Irreversible MAOIs on the NHS in the UK. There‚Äôs several other drugs I would like to try, but they are not available here (and would require being imported). For example, Desipramine looked like a really good option, but was taken off the market here. If I was to try something new, it would be Imipramine, which is Desipramine‚Äôs cousin, and breaks down into Desipramine. However, I don‚Äôt know how reluctant my Psychiatrist will be to prescribe it. 

So I was wondering if anyone has gone back on a previous medication and found better success? I‚Äôve been on so many over the years that, for some of them, I can remember how much they helped and whether it‚Äôs worth giving them another shot.",433
What medication next? Details provided. Please help!,"I present with OCD and Depression. Symptoms include; anhedonia, lack of motivation, mood instability - highs and lows (often), lack of self worth & desire to change things, not being able to get up in the mornings, get out of bed & sleeping too long, and anxiety (OCD). 

Past medication: Fluoxetine (Prozac), Sertraline (Zoloft), Escitalopram (Celexa), Paroxetine (Paxil), Venlafaxine (Effexor), Clomipramine (Anafranil), Buproprion (Wellbutrin), Buproprion & Fluoxetine, Modafinil [very short term] & Fluoxetine, Vortioxetine (Trintillex), Moclobemide & Aripiprazole (Abilify) & Clonazepam (Klonopin). 

I know that the likely suggestion will be an MAOI. However, it is extremely difficult to convince an NHS Psychiatrist in the UK, let alone a Private one, to prescribe an Irreversible MAOI. Also, they might be the best antidepressant of a bad bunch, but they do have quite strong side effects and, after experiencing this with Moclobemide, short half-life antidepressants that you have to take several times a day have always been an issue for me as I forget or don‚Äôt take them at the same time every day. 

What would you suggest, as my next medication, to try based on my symptoms?",434
Should I get a second opinion?,"So I recently had my 1st appointment with my Psychiatrist and it didn‚Äôt go quite like I had hoped.

He diagnosed me with Histrionic personality disorder when I asked to be assessed for Borderline personality disorder because the symptoms closely represented me. The disorder I was diagnosed with is the complete opposite of me and how I act. 
He also denied me a emotional support animal letter because he felt like that would be enabling me instead of helping me.

He wouldn‚Äôt up my anxiety meds even tho that‚Äôs the most prominent issue I‚Äôm dealing with.
He did however up my antidepressant from 25mg to 100mg. He skipped two dosage steps and that makes me nervous so I‚Äôm taking 50 for now. It‚Äôs Anafranil/clomipromine.

Then the weirdest part happened and he asked me about two questions on my ability to focus and I said I do have trouble focusing cause I feel like I disassociate a lot. He then tells me to get an adhd screening and in the meantime he will prescribe me something. I look at my CVS and he prescribed me adderall without a diagnosis and without telling me or warning. 


I just feel like it was really odd. Is this normal? 
If you take the time to read this or even comment with your opinion I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it. üíñ",435
What else can I do?,"This post is long, and I would be very grateful if you read it in its entirety. **If you can't/don't want to, I  highlighted most important stuff.** And sorry for my English.

Hi! **I   have depression since i was 11 at least, I start treatment at 18, and   now I am 23. My current diagnosis is recurrent depression**. *It can also might be very strange bipolar disorder*,   because sometimes I have sudden switches for no apparent reason. And   after switch i feel like my mood and mental health state has always been   like this. No mania and hypomania tho. Just bad -\*hop\*->less   bad-->...etc. *I also have really bad anxiety and probably CPTSD.*

My previous therapists agree that the problem is mainly **in my brain-body**.    Of course therapy helps, but then -- switch -- and I just randomly   feel better and can do more things. And then I can't do anything, only   crying in despair and agony day by day.

Unfortunately i don't remember exact schemes. **But I tried:**

\-  Sertraline  
\- Anafranil  
\-  Phenibut  
\- Amitriptyline  
\- fluoxetine  
\- mirtazapine  
\- Paroxetine  
\-  agomelatine (Valdoxan)  
\- Escitalopram? (Cipralex)  
\- trazodone (Trittico)  
\-  spitomine  
\- Venlafaxine

\- Quetiapine  
\- Teraligen  
\- Olanzapine  
\- Chlorprothixene  
\- Perphenazine (Etaperazin)  
\- aripiprazole

**Nothing seems to be working.**

*But maybe my last weird scheme with high (max?) dosage quetiapin and lamotrigine helped me crawl out of 6 mouth agony.* At least now I don't lie and cry for days.

Even   if it helped before, it doesn't do much now. I am still in pain and   it's still getting worse. I am skeptical about these scheme. I have a   feeling that if I drop them now (properly), nothing will change.   Unfortunately, I can't test this right now. Lately I've been walking on   thin ice and I feel that even with these drugs, if they work, I can  fall  into a terribly bad state. I'm afraid to take risks.

I am desperate.

It seems, that my condition slowly getting worst. I am able to do less and less things during past three years. I am scared.

I   live in Israel, and health system here is fucked up, to switch   psychiatrist will take mouths, so i can't search fast to find a great   one. at least I can strongly advise something to oke-ish one, this has   worked before with other specialists.

*Exercise,   good sleep schedule, meditation, supplement helped, ofcourse, but   didn't significantly change things.Also in some states it feels   impossible to do some of this stuff, even by tine steps. Thyroid gland   is fine, diet is ok.*

**What should I try next? What medication or method? I am open to anything.**

I am new to Reddit, feel free to redirect me somewhere more appropriate. Or maybe you know other reddit where I can post this?

If you curious of my full symptoms, [link here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DOeD778HIvv5vjIM5VigCDN-4Gii6YW13Rhex8R6FAM/edit?usp=sharing), but beware, it just machine google translate.

Feel at times i'm in a an unescapable weave webbed by deception (psych meds/tapering question),"So i'm taking psychiatric medication that kind of never worked at all in the first place and day one never wanted to take. A few years ago after being stable on olanzapine and citalopram (high doses mind you) I got switched. During the time I had these beliefs that all I really needed was to be slowly tapered, but when I told that to my psychiatrist and doctors at the ER, psychiatrist disregarded it ever being possible and ER staff admitted me, switched my meds and it's been pretty bad since trying every pill under the sun. During the time I tried tapering off medications I never had any success. I also had several attempts at coming off, at some points even made it weeks or months off just to return back to them.

Currently I am taking Pregabalin 75mg twice daily and well as Doxepin 10mg for sleep. I wish I could just be a good little non-functioning mental patient, but the thought always creeps into my head going back to tapering off medication that I was never able to figure out or get help with. It makes me feel like this is all my fault and i'll never escape because I have no idea how to taper off meds, nor do any mental health professionals I have ever come across. I've not since stopped medications and don't view that as an option. I also have no clue how one would even taper off of pregabalin or doxepin, they are capsuled medications.

Is this a delusion? Am I right? What's going on here if anyone knows i'd love input. Quell my anxiety, enforce the tapering thoughts, whatever ya got I want to hear.",437
Random crying,"Yesterday and today I cried pretty hard while driving and blasting Powermetal of all situations. It's been a stressfull week, full time job, 2 kids 3 and 11 and 5,5-6h of sleep a night. I don't understand why I cry, I'm on anti depressants (Doxepin) and on the waitlist for therapy. Any experiences, thoughts, advice?

I'm 27 m and usually don't cry often. Had a little breakdown a while ago after locking my keys in my car but apart from that I can't remember something more recent than 2 years ago",438
medication resistance for insomnia,"I have cycled through tens of medications in the past 3 years
prozac,trazadone,Seroquel,melatonin,ambien,doxepin,lexapro,lamotrigine,guanfacine,abilify
the whole nine yards,i have already found the medication that effectively helps my moods but half of my medications have been for sleep,ambien was the ONLY thing that ever put me to sleep but my insurance never covered it because i am a minor and the price just kept going up and up it got to $175 dollars at one point but i dont know what to do,i am trying to schedule a sleep study but theyre months out so what do i do in the meantime ,i feel like i‚Äôve exhausted all options, even the facebook mom approach of reading a book and shit like that,i just hate that i have no energy and theres nothing i can do about it,its progressively getting worse,i went from having trouble staying asleep to now not being able to sleep until my body is literally beginning to lose function,my body will be EXHAUSTED but my brain just goes and goes i wanna rip my hair out",439
"Got off Mirtazapine & Kratom cold turkey, what would you do now? Any experiences or advice?","I just got off Mirtazapine cold turkey like 2 weeks ago. Off Kratom since Friday, 9 December, had a relapse yesterday. I started using Lyrica (Pregabalin) on Sunday, 11 December, to combat and go through the withdrawals. I took it from Sunday to Friday last week. So 5 days in total, mostly 150mg in the morning, two days another 150mg in the evening. It really helped me to still go to work, be able to finish my tasks, and get out of bed or my apartment. I still suffer badly but it's the only thing that really helps me do something, get out of bed, and have way less social anxiety (still shy and introvert but way less antisocial and anxious, more talkative, esp no physical anxiety like shakes anymore). I took it these 5 days, then 2 days off (last Saturday and Sunday), then today again 150mg in the morning + 100mg in the evening as I had a university essay and a presentation today. It helped. I even think about going to the gym now, I managed to eat one whole meal so far, which is great.

My doc even prescribed me lyrica for daily use or whenever i need it but I never have been taking it more than once every one or two weeks as I was and still am horribly anxious about lyricas own dependance and withdrawal that can be bad according to some people. And that using it regularly just makes my condition worse in the end and offers me another bad withdrawal time that puts me even deeper to the ground of deep depression.

As I suffer more than anytime, probably because of withdrawing from Kratom AND Mirtazapine (while I thought Mirtazapine has no severe withdrawal, might also only be the kratom withdrawal), and I don't eat (lost 5kg/10lbs in these 2 weeks), I don't sleep and feel very fucked, insane, can't move much or do anything functional, I was wondering if it would be the best to just go back on Mirtazapine. But otherwise I'm very happy and proud that I got off Mirtazapine and don't have to take it daily anymore. I just don't know what to do. I know lyrica would help me if I continue taking it. But I also know there can be harsh withdrawal for many people who take Lyrica daily. Mirtazapine might have withdrawal, too and maybe I should just use this opportunity to finally get off Mirtazapine (which even didn't help my depression much, did nothing for my social anxiety, BUT it made me eat and sleep which can contribute to improving depression). Mirtazapine is the 14th med Im trying now, without much or any success. Life still has been a daily pain and suffering since trying these meds and 3 different psychotherapies for 5 or more years now.

What would you do in my position? Get on the lyrica train as many do and swear on but also many suffer from withdrawing in the end? Get back on Mirtazapine and hope to be better in one or two weeks, finally eating and sleeping again, and getting back on my weight (I always was skinny but now am really thin cauese of not being able to eat or drink at all).

Also my doc just prescribed me Lithium (as my 15th med to try plus 30mg Mirtazapine - my doc doesnt know that I quit it) on last Monday but as I don't suffer bipolar depression and I couldn't find any information or studies for Lithium being succesful for unipolar depression or social anxiety (which is my biggest source of depression) I just hesistated to take it until now.

Otherwise I also have many supplements left I still wanted to try and had hope that they can be finally ""heal"" me. Lavender extract, Bacopa, Rhodiola Rosea extract, SAM-e, Dopa Mucuna, Lemon Balm, Gotu Kola extract, Magnolia Bark extract, GABA (not bought yet but maybe was thinking of: Kanna, Lions Mane Mushroom, DXM low dose, Polygala, Tongkat Ali?). Can any of these be helpful for my withdrawal and depression and social anxiety even if 14 pharmaceutical meds didn't help?

It's hard to decide which way to go as all of these meds need time to work and I don't have the time or ability to suffer that long until I know if a med or supplement works or if it does not.

* Lithium seems so unuseful for my issues as there are only studies using it for bipolar, but I don't have bipolar depression, still my doc sees a reason why she prescribed it to me, I guess, as next trial after 14 failed meds and 3 failed psychotherapies. I just don't see the reason as there is no science I can find behind it.
* I could take Mirtazapine and I know I'd probably start eating and sleeping again in 1-2 weeks thanks to Mirtazapine but otherwise I think I might get dependent on it (Idk if this is withdrawal from Mirtazapine or Kratom or both, but if it's Mirtazapine too, I'd be better now off of it than prolonging the use and withdrawal of Mirtazapine).
* I surely won't touch Kratom again for a while as I've really been dependent on it, and it just fucks with my mental health after one week daily use and I also don't eat on it to get effects on empty stomach 24/7. It just isn't worth using it daily and I have to take a looong break from it until I can start using it like once a week max. Because I know when I only used it once a week it was effective and giving me good results but daily use just worsens my state a lot.
* I could continue Lyrica, with the very high risk for dependence and withdrawal when trying to quit it one day but I know it works for my social anxiety better than any med before, even if it's only a little lift. Otherwise many use it daily as no other meds worked and they just pay the price for a bit of life quality and one day going off of it with bad withdrawals and maybe long-term damage (?). How's your experience with Lyrica as therapeutical daily use for depression and social anxiety? Ever tried to get off of it? Is it possible or a very bad idea to use it daily even if it's the only thing helping a bit?
* I could try any of the above mentioned supplements I still haven't tried (I tried many others before without success but maybe you have some other supps that helped you with treatment-resistant depression and social anxiety when no other even strong pharmaceutical meds didn't help. but at that point I also think, if strong pharmaceutical meds couldn't help me or treat me right, how could a supplement do?)
* I could ask for another medication than Lithium. I will surely tell my doc that I hesistated to try Lithium until now as I couldn't find any studies on it for my issues anywhere and was overthinking of going on another med again, just failing, having no success and maybe side effects and withdrawal of it for no success or effects in contrary. What meds could I still try if 14 meds didn't work?

I already tried these meds and no one treated my depression and social anxiety, not even touched it except for Mirtazapine enabling me to eat more and sleep better:

* Escitalopram (Cipralex)
* Promethazine
* Venlafaxine (Effexor)
* Quetiapine (Seroquel)
* Sertraline (Zoloft)
* Opipramol
* Paroxetine (Paxil)
* Duoloxetine (Cymbalta)
* Moclobemide (Aurorix) (weakest MAOI)
* Amitriptyline
* Gabapentin
* Diazepam (Valium)
* Mirtazapine (Remeron) => makes me eat and sleep, probably lil effective cause of helping with that
* Bupropion (Wellbutrin)
* Pregabalin (Lyrica) => lil effective

All no success. Plus 2 depth psychological psychotherapies and 1 cognitive behavioral therapy, all failed, too. No success.

Still open to try, some meds I just noted some days I was desperated and surfing through the web for alternatives and relief:

* Ketamine (any experiences? also expensive and hard to find where I live)
* Psilocybin (Magic Mushrooms) (have big anxiety of horror trips and psychosis etc., also illegal here)
* Ayahuasca (maybe in a south american treatment center but hella expensive)
* rTMS or ECT (any experiences? also hard to find)
* Meds I didn't try yet: Tranylcypromin (Parnate, irreversible MAOI, affects both enzymes in comp to Moclobemide), Clomipramine (but serotonergic drug and ssris/snris never worked so far), Lamotrigine (Mood Stabilizer, idk if this would be making sense?), Selegiline (MAO-B-I), Amisulpride (low dose should be effective for social anxiety and drive/energy/anhedonia), Tianeptine (Sulfat/Sodium, but should have a high addiction and withdrawal risks as I heard), Vortioxitine (Serotomodulator/stimulator), Buspirone, Hydroxzine, Risperidone (Mood Stabilizer), Abilify (Add-On, potent. AD one doc I found on youtube swears on being effective for depression for every of his patients he tried it on, maybe antipsychotic worth a try?), Rasagiline (MAO-B-I), Tofisopam, Trimipramine, Doxepine, Milnaneurax, Propranolol, Dopaminergic: Pramipexol, Ropinirol, Mianserine, Maprotiline, ADHD meds (i possibly suffer from ADD and just never got diagnosed it? reason why no meds or therapies worked so far for me as wrong diagnosis?: Atomoxetin, Modafinil, Ritalin, Dexamphetamin, Lisdexamfetamin), other Benzos (Clonazepam, Bromazepam, Alprazolam, Oxazepam)

Any idea what you'd do in my position? Rn I don't eat and just starve all the time, I don't drink, I don't sleep, this is very unhealthy so I have to do something PLUS my horrible depression and social anxiety not enabling me to go out, see friends, just canceling all appointments, dont visit university anymore and probably just have to quit my masters degree and never make real friends or romantic relationships, having no future in sight, while also being cognitively very retared and probably just turned dumb, no skills, no knowledge, just no future and no strengths or anything I could offer anyone - and the anxiety I could never catch up on all these things, skills, knowledge and experience other already have in my age (im 23 now).

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of experience and knowledge to survive in adulthood EVEN IF let's say survive depression and social anxiety itself. I don't know, I surely remember when I first noticed my mental health issues that my deep depression had big impacts on my cognition and joy or ability to learn things. The social anxiety contributed to this ""cogntive performance/ability"" in public of course. Now I don't know if it might have been all the many different meds I tried or the depression or a combination which made me so freaking dumb that kills my hope for being able to live a normal life even if I'd be able to finally ever feel not fucking hellishly depressed and freakingly socially anxious once. These are thoughts like I just dont have learned any skills, any knowledge about any topic or profession, might it just be football, basketball, following it on the TV and knowing about players, I don't know anything about cars or mechanics as some men my age do and makes them somehow ""manly"" for me, I can't play any instrument or don't play any sports in a team, I don't know anything about politics or any science topic. I'm just blank. Only positive I see is that I'm at least a good looking young man, a good looking loser. I feel so unmanly because of not knowing anything about this stuff and have no skills or knowledge I can offer. Makes me suicidal and reducing my self confidence and self worth a lot. I was really often thinking about having ADD (but started only very late or no one rarely urged to test me on this as I have social anxiety and by that surely am not the hyperactive ADHD type - i heard the missing H part is the reason why many ADHD patients get ignored even if the attention deficit disorder is still fully present).

I really have big hopes on meds even if 14 different ones didn't work yet but I don't know how my life could change other than a med, supplement or any substance being finally effective and supporting me cause I tried so much (therapies, diet, sports - they only help a little) and I really think it's just my brain chemistry and it can't get better without any substance helping me... even my new doc said this type of depression and anxiety I have can only be solved by pharmaceutical help or biochemical influence from the outside as so much didn't help me until now and I tried so much.

Sorry for the long text. This makes me see that Lyrica helped me to day with my issues as otherwise I would never have the energy to write so much and not feel bad and just crawl into my bed doing nothing than starving and staring on the wall or trying to sleep and just not feel my horrible feelings of depression, self hate and future anxiety. I really am living unhealthy now, so at this moment I really take even withdrawal of lyrica just to survive. But idk if this is a very bad idea. I try to not take it tomorrow, but maybe I feel so horrible again that I have to at least eat one meal, drink a bit of water, get out and get something done for university or other todos I just skipped for 2 weeks now...",440

Someone with chronic suicidal thoughts..,"**not suicidal**
Hello. 31/f. I have chronic depression and chronic suicidal thoughts. But *you wouldn't know it, if I didn't tell you*. I don't resemble the sad donkey from pooh bear: just an ordinary mom/wife/nurse. 

I'm on Paxil and Imipramine and for the most part, do okay--obviously, I'm still alive! Haha. (Gotta laugh sometimes). Anyways, I'm a big advocate of mental health and encourage open discussions about it. 

I don't ever see or hear of any others with chronic suicidal thoughts. So, I'm initiating my own search. 

With CST (chronic suicidal thoughts), I often find myself wondering about just up and disappearing. I don't want to harm myself or others-- I just want to die. Nothing in particular will set off a suicidal thought, it's just pops out of nowhere. I could be having the best day of my life: ""drive into a wall"". Or, just a regular day: ""paint the ceiling"". To clarify, I'm not into self harm at all; I'm not 'trying to feel alive' or take away any mental/physical pain. Maybe people who ""out of nowhere klld themselves, without any signs"", had what I have. Cause the thoughts literally just appear at complete randomness. 

With my medications, I'll only have one or two 'breakthroughs' a year--which is nice, since in the past I've been caught planning my death. I don't have the courage to go through with it, thank God! 

No one understands it. I often hear, ""what about your child?"", and I try to explain that 'in the moment' I literally am only thinking about death. It's not that I choose that, it just is. I love my boy and my husband, but it feels out of my control at times. Thankfully, I'm self aware and can raise a red flag when I feel I'm declining. I always alert my husband and best friend. 

Side note: I've always been fascinated by cemeteries and the after life, since I've been a little kid probably around 5. No real reason why, just have been. Ironically, I work as a hospice nurse. Oddly, I'm spot on about reading people and recognizing true intentions of others/strangers and people open up to me frequently,  I seem to attract sad people. I don't mind it, just curious as to why...Maybe this stems from some other mental condition or is hyper vigilance? Also, not sure if this is biologic or??

I want to know if there is anyone else with this? Is there any treatments that have helped in the longterm? I'd like to get weaned off medication if possible, if not, I'll stay on  them. Just wanted to get my feet wet and see if others had any input. Personal or professional responses welcomed!

Hi searching for answers because nothings help,"Long post
Hi so I have really bad anxiety/panic attacks/tantrums. I'm 29 M. So I'm really here just looking for answers or help. I have this problem we're if I don't go for a run like 5 to 6 miles a day my mind just goes haywire. I have severe anxiety anger issues and depression and generally can't leave the house or my room or I struggle to, but the one thing that seems to calm me down and function is running long distance if I don't end up having panic attacks and basically mental paralysis. Now iv basically had this my whole life even when I was 12 - 13 I had to for 4 mile runs just to stay calm. I'm wondering if anyone has heard of this or anything people have tried to help with it.. I'm limiting my alcohol intake to almost zero and that has helped.
 I'm currently taking magnesium and vitamin D 
Avulity for depression and nortriptyline for depression and anxiety I think. Iv tried maybe 20 different ssris (Wellbutrin, Zoloft ect) and nothing has seemed to help this build up of anxiety that happens. I basically can't think straight or have conversations or enjoy things. Let me know if you have any advice.",444
"A month ago, I started taking sertraline 50mg and nortriptyline50mg, then, the mild and slight tinnitus that i felt just sometimes, turned into severe tinnitus and constant whistling sound... because of which one of these two drugs do you think it is? And What can I do to improve and reduce it?","Hello, I am 30 years old male.

After 6 years of continuous every day and night use of opioids especially methadone, it has been 79 days since I quit and I am sober from opioids.

I would like to add that I have been taking Clonazepam 1 mg for about 10 years and Quetiapine 25 mg for 5 years.

I also told my psychiatrist about tinnitus and he told me to go to an otolaryngologist for an examination and then see what happens.

1 month ago and before starting sertraline and nortriptyline, I didn't feel the tinnitus that I had even for weeks, and every time I felt, it was not to the extent that it was annoying and then it got better for a very very short time.

In general, it was to the extent that I felt it very, very little and it was not annoying at all, but now it really bothers me.

I saw my psychiatrist just a few days ago, and since my condition has not improved, he also prescribed bupropion 150 mg, and now I have started half of 75 mg for 3 days, which I have to gradually increase until the dose is 150 mg per day, but I feel In these 3 days of taking bupropion, tinnitus has become more severe!",445
SOL with antidepressants,"Hello!

I have been going through it lately and was prescribed two antidepressants by my doctor (one after the other). 

Lexapro (10mg) gave me no change and just provided me with ED. 

Nortriptyline (25mg) made me manic and didn‚Äôt make me feel any better. 

I told my doctor that I didn‚Äôt want to try more pills because I would rather feel terrible without medication than terrible with. 

Has anyone has earnest and true success on any SSRIs or TCAs? I don‚Äôt want to come off as an addict toward my doc by asking for a certain kind of pill. However, I can‚Äôt keep living like this and counseling would not provide me any benefit (I‚Äôm a very private person). 

Any advice/experiences/stories would help. 

Thanks :)",446
Should I change my psychiatrist?,"I've been seeing this psychiatrist for 2 years now and he doesn't seem to listen to me. I'm currently on Nortriptyline - 40mg and it's been giving me unpleasant side effects. So, I told him about it and he said that my dosage is too low and that's why I don't see any good results. 

Side effects I've experienced: 

1. Memory impairment - I've lost my wallet twice, my workbag and left my laptop in a public toilet a couple of times üôÉ
2. Anxiety 
3. Angry - I'm always so angry all the time 
4. Heart palpitations

He also mentioned that the reason why I don't see any positive changes is due to me constantly changing my medications. Um... SIR??? I changed them because it made me suicidal, get anxiety attacks, constantly sleepy and etc., 

yes so... should I change my psychiatrist?..",447
Any medications that can help to get and stay asleep?,"I can‚Äôt ever fall asleep unless it‚Äôs late (2, 3, 4 in the morning) and I sometimes have to get up at 5:20am. 

I‚Äôve tried quite a bit: Xanax, Clonazepam, Melatonin, Nortriptyline, Seroquel, and Trazadone. All of them either have bad side effects or just make me drowsy, but doesn‚Äôt help me fall asleep.

Wondering if there‚Äôs anything you may have tried that I could bring up to my psychiatrist next time I go see him.

I need help about depression and start using Escitalopram and Aripiprazole or not...,"Hello, I am 30 years old, and since childhood there were a series of problems in my life, and since I was about 16 years old, various mental conflicts caused my bad mood, depression and drug use.
Since I was about 18 years old, I have been taking 1 mg of clonazepam every night until now, when I really feel that it has very harmful effects and side effects, and it is really bothering me, and I really want to stop taking this pill, but it is really difficult.
I have been taking morphine continuously for the last 6 years.
For the past 3 years, I have been taking 20 mg of methadone a day, and now I have completely quit morphine and methadone for about two months.
The biggest problems I have now are:
I have never been my true self since I was young, and I still am not, and I am afraid that I have shown my true self, and I have limited myself since I was young, and I still do, and I do not like the character that I created for myself at all, and I am sick of it, and I have no self-confidence.
I hate myself and I know that I must change, but I have been involved in this issue for a long time and I cannot change and be comfortable with myself.
My concentration is very low and my mind is constantly thinking and only negative thoughts flow in my mind, which I have no control over.
I have no motivation and hope to do anything.
I have no passion and taste.
I rarely enjoy the things I should enjoy.
I have no motivation to improve myself.
My body is very weak, but I don't do anything, even though I know I must exercise.
I kind of gave up and suicidal thoughts have always been with me for several years and I really want to die.
I really want to just take drugs sometimes and sleep without being in this world.
Lately, I want to take methadone and clonazepam again and be in the world of self-denial.
But there is still a part of me that wants to get better, but it has become very weak lately.
It's very strange to me that I can't even start a little exercise!
After quitting methadone, the psychiatrist prescribed Escitalopram and Aripiprazole for me, but I have no trust in these doctors and these pills at all, and I think they have very very low effect and have very bad side effects, but I feel so bad that a part of me wants to give up and start taking the pills, but I have a problem, although they must be used for a long period of time, and on the other hand, I would like to try the microdose of magic mushrooms, but if I take these pills, I can't do that anymore.
Even now, because I am taking clonazepam and before that I was taking methadone, I did not start microdosing magic mushrooms.
I have taken SSRI and Nortriptyline before, but they had very little effect and did not make me feel better, it just made it easier for me to live this way.
And I forgot to say that I have been taking Quetiapine 25mg every night for about 4 years.
I used to take a higher dose, but now there is only 25 mg, and I will soon quit this pill, and I don't even know what harmful effects this pill has had on me in the past few years, I know this about clonazepam.
As for mushrooms, my life is divided into two parts: before a high-dose mushroom trip and after that, that trip really changed me and made me improve a lot and become better, but unfortunately, I went down a path I shouldn't have followed for a while, and my condition has gotten worse recently.
Now I can't start anything and it's like my mind is somehow locked that I want to make a series of moves to get better and it's a few years have we been like this.
I thought that I would get better after quitting methadone and started exercising, but I only got worse now and my body weakness is much more visible, which is really annoying.
I welcome any advice and help regarding about quitting clonazepam.
And whether to take Escitalopram and Aripiprazole or not?!!
Whether to try the mushroom microdose when I am also taking clonazepam or not.
I really do not know what to do!
I just want to feel better.
I just wanna exercise, meet new people, have plans for myself, playing my electric guitar again, read books, the improvement of my concentration that I lost, not to thinking all the time and no control on my thoughts and many other things like these stuff.",449
I need advice,"Hello i'm 30 years old M, after 6 years of daily use of opioids and especially methadone, I went to a mental hospital and the addiction specialist there gave me buprenorphine 4mg a day and after 5-6 months of taking it and taper off the dose, I have not taken it for 20 days now.

But now my main problem is that the mental hospital doctor (addiction specialist) sent me to a very young female and probably inexperienced psychiatrist who works in the same hospital there and after talking to me for 20 minutes, he prescribed Escitalopram 10mg with Aripiprazole 5mg And she said that after a month of taking the pills, I will go to her again for a visit... After a few minutes, she asked me about my special obsession and many other things from childhood that if I was a very noisy and mischievous child or not and many other things.

So i already had an appointment with a psychiatrist, who is a more experienced and well-known doctor in my city, and I said there is no harm in seeing him as well, and this doctor prescribed Sertraline 50mg twice a day one at noon and one at night with two Nortriptyline 25mg at night that means 50mg and a month later I will go to him again and of course, I should start with lower doses of these two drugs and gradually increase the dose every few days until I reach the dose I mentioned.

Now I really don't know which doctor and which medicines to go with!

I would like to add that I still have some physical withdrawal symptoms from quitting opiods, such as mild body pain - sweating - feeling so weak and tierd and nerve pain, which nerve pain is resolved with pregabalin.

I also have been taking Clonazepam 1mg every night for about 10-12 years, and I have been taking it from my mother's pills since I was 19-20 years old, when I got addicted to it, and I have been taking the Quetiapine 25mg every night for about 5-6 years, which a doctor gave me to quit Clonazepam in such a way that I start with half a tablet of Quetiapine 25mg and reduce the Clonazepam and increase Quetiapine, but i tried and I could not do this and since then I have been taking Quetiapine 25mg every night.

I want to say that I was suffering from depression since I was 20-22 years old and I took Sertraline and Escitalopram before. Each for almost a year before I got addicted to opioids and opioid made me feel very good for the first 3-4 years of use, but then everything got worse.

Fear of communicating with strangers and crowded places, especially girls

It has become more difficult for me to talk and communicate with people now

Lack of self confidence

Lack of enthusiasm and motivation to the extent that it is difficult for me to wake up and get out of bed

Severe overthinking and negative thoughts (my mind is like a highway of negative and even ridiculous thoughts and it is all in the future and the past and different thoughts and many times I can't shut it up and I keep jumping from one thought to another) which has also caused my lack of concentration and focus

Unpleasantness (maybe anhedonia) and not enjoying the things that used to give me pleasure

Very empty, meaningless and aimless thoughts of seeing life and continuing it

I have no hope for life and future

I must say this, it is very important that I could not communicate with any girl until I was 22-23 years old and I did not have sex, so I was completely afraid of meeting a girl and i become very anxious when meeting a girl and I could not talk at all, but when we were only boys, I was very comfortable and very comfortableI for talking and and after a while and several times going out with girls or having a small party at home with girls, when I saw that I was like this, I ran away from this situation and every encounter with girls and for 4-5 years I tried not to think about it at all...

So when I saw that my friend was going to go out with some girls, I ran away from this situation for several years because I was anxious and sometimes I couldn't speak a single word even when they told me why you are so quiet and talk and work on yourself.

So only when we boys were supposed to be together, I used to go out and I did this from the age of 18 until the age of 22-23, which bothered me a lot and my friends also asked how come you are not in a relationship with any girl and this was also very annoying and I had no answer and I just ran away until I got acquainted with psychedelics and a weak trip of LSD and then magic mushrooms and then at the age of 22-23, I had a heavy mushroom trip, which showed me all this, all these escapes and manyyyyyyy other things... a trip report is long, and then I could hardly have sex for the first time, and when I got addicted to opioids, it became easy for me to communicate with others and girls, I was able to get to know different girls almost easily, talk, spend time and have sex, but now it's hard for me to communicate with strangers, especially girls again.",450

Mixtures & side effects,"
This may not be the right place, so please delete if so. 

I suffer from severe ADHD, Anxiety and clinical depression. I take 60 mg of Adderall a day for my ADHD. I do not take anything for my anxiety or depression but I really need to because it‚Äôs getting very hard to function. I took 10 mg of Lexapro for almost 2 years watch at first really helped with the depression and anxiety but I honestly felt emotion less. It also took away healthy anxiety so I wouldn‚Äôt do things because I didn‚Äôt have anxiety about it. After six months of taking it I had a slow increase in weight gain that was hard to notice until time passed and  I gained a significant amount. I stopped taking it because Gaining weight made me very depressed. I have body dysmorphia and even 5 pounds of weight gain is unbearable to me. I have heard a bunch of mixed things about Wellbutrin for depression. But I also saw that it can be dangerous to mix with Adderal. Is Wellbutrin and Adderall ever prescribe together? Is it safe? Are there any antidepressants that don‚Äôt cause weight gain and work well with ADHD medications? 

TLDR: Is it dangerous to be prescribed Wellbutrin and Adderal? Is it possible to take an antidepressant without gaining weight, even 5lbs?",452
SSRI use bad experience now good,"Hi there! I‚Äôm struggling big time lately not being on medication and I wanted to reach out for some maybe past experiences for some people to see if things changed for others.

In the past(early 20‚Äôs) I tried taking many medications that were SSRI‚Äôs and had always had the worst of the side effects being severe ideation; or actual attempts on my life. I went on aventyl (tricycling antidepressant) when I was about 26 and it actually helped for a little while, and didn‚Äôt give me that same experience.

I‚Äôm now 29, and wondering if the side effect that I experienced was due to something research has shown to happen with people under the age of 25 on antidepressants; and was wondering- have you had that previous experience with SSRI‚Äôs and now have had a better experience now that you‚Äôre older?

Antidepressant Cymbalta/Duloxotine withdrawal: Suggestions for dealing with the symptoms or speeding up?,"28 yr old female who has been on Cymbalta for about 6 years to treat Generalized Anxiety disorder and Fibromyalgia symptoms. I was taking 60mg twice per day and then was only taking one 60mg once per day for 2 weeks as suggested by my doctor before starting a new antidepressant prescription: 10mg of Aventyl to eventually get up to taking 5 10mg pills per day. 

The reason I wanted to switch to a different antidepressant was because if was no longer working for me. 

I thought I was dying or losing my mind or something until I Googled how long duloxotine/Cymbalta withdrawal can last and apparently it can be up to 3 or even 6 weeks! It's been only one week. I told my doctor about my concerns about the withdrawal symptoms from the times I've run out in the past and that's why we tapered the dosage but... obviously it didn't work. 

My withdrawal symptoms: 
.

. Insomnia. My ADHD symptoms are so much worse and my brain won't shut up and let me fall asleep. When the insomnia goes on for too long I start to disassociate and have difficulty determining if I'm awake or sleeping. Things get trippy while awake like I'm wearing someone's glasses or looking in a fun house mirror. Sometimes its like I'm stuck in the Dolly zoom camera effect in movies where I feel like I should have physically reached somewhere by now...
.

. Severely vivid nightmares when I do manage to fall asleep every single night. Sometimes they will wake me up in a full blown Anxiety attack. I'll also wake up drenched in sweat and my entire body clenched tight. Even when I run my air conditioner as low as it can go in my room in hopes of it helping me have a deeper sleep, I can wake up drenched in sweat like I was in a sauna.
.

. Exhaustion from the lack of sleep, causing significantly worse ADHD symptoms, worse anxiety symptoms, causing very low mood and no motivation to do anything. I could burst out I tears over the tiniest provocation right now. 
.

. Diarrhea and indigestion. Either the stress and my whole life being out of whack is causing my IBS symptoms to flare up or its happening on it's own. I could eat something like beets at a very late lunch at 2pm and see the beets again at 7pm. Nothing looks fully digested. 
.

. Nausea, indigestion and bloating is making me very hesitant to eat at a regular schedule. 
.

. Vertigo/lightheadedness/tinnitus. Ps, this is not exactly textbook symptom and when the problem starts up again it is a bit of a mystery. Had seen a ENT and had an MRI a few years back to try to figure it out but there was no obvious cause. Essentially I get a pulsing feeling in my ears and a high pitched bell ""üéµbringggüéµ bringgggüéµ"" sound in my ears like an old fashioned telephone and sometimes my eyes flicker like the lights are dimming during a storm or power outage..... but this happens specifically when my eyeballs move side to side but not up and down.... this symptom might just be a coincidence too. Very light vertigo, mostly foggy lightheadedness. 



The insomnia, nightmares and diarrhea are the biggest problems right now and its making me beyond miserable and feeling like I'm losing my mind.

Mirtazapine extreme fatigue normal?,"So I‚Äôve been taking Mirtazapine for the last few days, and the level of fatigue I‚Äôve felt is extreme to say the least and I was wondering if anyone else has had this issue. Before anyone asks, yes I have contacted my provider at this point and I had labs done prior to starting it, everything is normal there. I‚Äôve been taking Mirtazapine at 7.5 mg for the last few days, and the side effects have been pretty extreme. I knew drowsiness is a common side effect, so I was prepared for it and have only taken it before bed, making sure I have 12 hours before my next shift at work so the worst of it would be slept through. But it‚Äôs much worse than I expected, to the point it‚Äôs actually been negatively impacting my life. I feel like my body is made of lead, I‚Äôm struggling to do basic functions like writing and at times I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to collapse because my body feels so heavy. I‚Äôm not able to focus on anything, which is especially bad since I work graves at a psych facility and I need to be aware while at work. I‚Äôve had multiple coworkers and managers ask me if I was ok, because apparently I look awful and they‚Äôre concerned which means I‚Äôve had to inform them that I‚Äôm taking antidepressants in the first place which I didn‚Äôt exactly want to advertise. The night nurse pulled me aside and actually did a check up, which is how I‚Äôve found out I currently have a fever as well, which has made things worse, and she‚Äôs suggested I stop taking the medication and reach out to my doctor, which I‚Äôm considering at this point. This has also started affecting my college work as well, because I was completely unconscious from 9am on Saturday until 1040pm on Sunday, during which I missed an exam that is worth a large portion of my grade that I don‚Äôt think the professor will let me retake since he‚Äôs very strict with time management. This also made me late for work, since I work up an hour after my shift started. I thought the drowsiness wouldn‚Äôt be an issue since I also take two separate simulates (Concerta ER 36mg and Modafinil 100mg) as I do have pretty severe ADHD and idiopathic hypersomnia so I thought they would balance things out well, but it‚Äôs not had any effect at all. The fatigue is bad enough that the first day I took it I spent 2 hours in bed trying to get my body to move. Is this level of fatigue normal? If I stop taking the medication, how long will it take for me to get back to normal. If anyone else has had issues like this or have an advice, I‚Äôd appreciate it. It‚Äôs been less than a week, and it‚Äôs heavily impacted my schooling so I don‚Äôt want to continue taking it. ",456
"Skipping Tonight's Mirtazapine Dose?
","Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of a bind tonight and could use your advice. I've been taking 30mg of Mirtazapine every night before bed as prescribed. I've been on it since early 2020, starting with 15mg, and then upped to 30mg in August 2022 after consulting with my doctor.

However, tonight is a rare night out for me, and I'm worried about feeling too tired from the medication, especially if I'm drinking. I don't want to have taken a medication like this shortly beforehand and then consume alcohol.

Would it be alright to skip tonight's dose so I can fully enjoy the night without feeling overly drowsy? I'll get back on track with my regular dosage tomorrow.

Appreciate your thoughts on this!",457
Fear of taking Mirtazapine,"Hello everybody. I have been suffering from severe insomnia and anxiety for a few months now. I am also somebody that is extremely nervous and fearful of medications in general. I was on an Ssri (Prozac) recently and went off of it out of fear and thinking it was causing more issues than it was helping and now I believe it really was helping me and my insomnia to a degree and I‚Äôve made a mistake. My insomnia and anxiety got bad again recently I believe due to this and just two days ago I was prescribed 15mg of Mirtazapine. I took it for the last two nights and I was able to sleep, though I do think I felt considerably foggier the next day. It didn‚Äôt take long before I read about the horror stories associated with Mirtazapine and weight gain and even worse rebound insomnia from the withdrawal and now I am extremely hesitant to take this medication for any length of time and feel I should likely start back on the Prozac and potentially use this as a short term sleep aid to get through the point of the Prozac building up in my system. I just wanted to to ask, what was your guy‚Äôs experience taking Mirtazapine? If or when you tried to go off of it, how bad was the withdrawal and rebound insomnia and how long were you taking it before then? Thank you all very much.",458

It appears the medication is working as the 8ish hours has been consistent since Tuesday, yet today, I appear to be beyond dizzy. Driving to work was almost unbearable and made me nauseous. Thankfully, I have a very lax job so now that I'm here I can just focus on work. 

Is this just a normal side effect for those that have tried this medication? Or should I be more concerned? Thanks for any personal experience or thoughts in advance!",460
"Coming off of Mirtazapine, need advice","Hi, I don‚Äôt know how much information you need, so I‚Äôll do my best to be informative without being overwhelming. Let me know if you need more details.

I‚Äôve been on Mirtazapine for 4-5 years for depression, anxiety and PTSD, I completed another round of therapy earlier this year and have been in a really good place since then with my mental health. I want to stop taking the Mirtazapine, and have decreased my dose under my doctors supervision so far. My last dose decrease was October, I‚Äôm on 15mg, and I want to stop taking it now but I can‚Äôt get an appointment (phone or otherwise) until after new year. I‚Äôm considering tapering the dose myself over the next two weeks while I‚Äôm with my parents.

The main motivation for my doing this now rather than waiting is that I‚Äôm worried the Mirtazapine has been messing with my blood pressure and heart rate. I‚Äôm working with my doctor about my concerns regarding my blood pressure, but if the Mirtazapine is contributing and I‚Äôm already planning on stopping it I‚Äôd rather do so now.

I‚Äôm open to opinions, suggestions, I‚Äôd love advice from anyone who‚Äôs been on Mirtazapine a long time and come off of it.

My other medications are Levothyroxine (hashimotos hypothyroid) and Topiramate for migraines.",461
mirtazapine withdrawal? help,"I want to get off mirtazapine team but read there were horrible side effects unless I do a 10-month taper?? I asked my psychiatrist about it and he told me I could quit cold turkey as I've only been on it for about 8 months. But he also told me I could quit Lamictal cold turkey and latuda cold turkey, which is not true at least for me and I ended up tapering myself off of both of those so frankly I don't trust him when it comes to getting off of medication. I've had several psychiatrists who are highly rated tell me the same thing, and I don't know what to believe. I've reduced the mitazepine to half a dose and I'm already starting to feel weird and depressed. Has anyone experienced coming off of mirtazapine?",462

"Flu symptoms, is it Mirtazapine withdrawal or buscopine side effects?","It's been 4 weeks since I cold turkeyd mirtazapine, I was on 15mg. I started 5mg twice a day of Buscopine hydrochloride 2 weeks and 2 days ago. I think the problem is mirtazapine, because the ill feeling started after I quit that, but there's such limited information about withdrawal, with many places saying it should only last 2 weeks. My symptoms are feeling cold, but my body is warm to the touch (no fever). Achey muscles. Feeling really unmotivated, like I can't be bothered doing anything. Just generally feeling like I am ill, but not fully ill. It goes up and down, but I had a couple of alcoholic drinks on the weekend and that seemed to make it much worse (I don't normally drink often). It also made me feel sick from the buscopine again (side effect I got immediately but is common). Sorry I'm rambling. I have a doctors appointment booked but just looking for some comfort this evening while I feel at a loss. Just want to find a medication that works without dealing with all these side effects :(",464
Fluoxetine with Mirtazapine,"Hi all. I recently saw my psychiatrist due to sudden unexplained sleeplessness that started last month that has brought about a relapse of my depression symptoms from a few years ago.

How can I lose weight on Escitalopram and Mirtazapine?,"Hello everyone, since I have problems with my anxiety, today I was prescribed Escitalopram(10g) and Mirtazapine(15g). 

I started practicing alternate day fasting a month ago and now got used to it. Also, I go to the gym and make some cardio exercises but unfortunately it‚Äôs not very regularly. 

As far as I know, Mirtazapine really increases appetite. If I resist it, will the desire to eat more go away? Could you please share your experience on using these medications and trying to lose weight?",466
Question about off brand Mirtazapine,"Hi, I hope it‚Äôs ok to ask this question here. I take Mirtazapine and I went to a budget chemist and didn‚Äôt check their alternate brand they gave me until that night. They had substituted for Axit 30 (small, round orange tablets) and as soon as I took them out of the packet I remembered how weird they smell and taste (yes even to swallow). I had this experience  about a year ago and since then the chemist I usually go to dispenses the brand medication.

Am I alone, or have others found this with Axit? I‚Äôve never had such a strong smelling and weird tasting tablet in my life. Hopefully I won‚Äôt make the same mistake but it‚Äôs obviously not just a weird batch because the last time, like I said was over a year ago. Thanks",467
Anyone experience lack of appetite coming off of Mirtazapine/Remeron?,Basically title. Quit 7.5mg Mirtazapine a few days ago and have been struggling to eat or feel hungry. Wanted to see if anyone else experienced this,468
Is it safe to stop taking mirtazapine now?,"I've only been taking 15mg of mirtazapine for 2 nights now but today I have been spaced out and lightheaded all day much more than the previous days, making it even harder for me to fall asleep now and I don't really feel like making this feeling stronger for the next 2 or so weeks. Would it be OK for me to just stop taking them. I'd rather feel a bit anxious and depressed every day than whatever it is I'm feeling right now. I've also heard that the withdrawal effects are even worse so I just don't want to feel anything like this right now.",469
"Medication for depression & anxiety that's not an SSRI, Wellbutrin, or Mirtazapine","I'm looking for antidepressant medication options that are not an SSRI or Wellbutrin.

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist this week and I would like to reach out to her ahead of time with a list of medication options I'd like to discuss. Unfortunately her MO in appointments is to basically rattle off medications off the top of her head and ask me which I'd like. It feels like a stab in the dark, so I want both of us to be prepared for this upcoming appointment.

Side effects for SSRIs are too much and usually lead me to a crisis event with high suicidality at 6 months. Wellbutrin doesn't play well with my heart medication and my cardiologist advised against it. Mirtazapine makes me sleep 14 hours a day and I've gotten in a lot of trouble at work since starting it two months ago.

What other medications should I consider with my psychiatrist? Thanks!",470
"mirtazapine 15 MG 3 months, Low mood","  

I have been prescribed mirtazapine ODT. And I have been taking it daily for about 3 months. 

Prior to taking my meds, I was actively exercising 

(I would ride my bike for about 60Km every weekend) and I was weighing about 85KG. 

When I started taking the meds, I stopped exercising and I gained weight to about 102 KG now. I know this is expected. 

And in all honesty, the meds worked amazingly, I felt great, I accomplished a lot at work, I travelled. played PC games after years! I also had significantly cut down my alcohol.

I still do drink, but its just to about 4 beers at night. 

So, I decided to run bit daily starting this week Monday. And that‚Äôs when my mood started getting low. And at random times for few hours, I‚Äôll be normal, and then back to a low mood. I am feeling uneasy, not like how I was when I started the meds. 

I decided to trace back abit on why this is occurring.

1) On Sunday afternoon after watching some Netflix, I decided to take a nap around 12 where I woke up around 730-8 pm. This was the first trigger, but not a major one, I don‚Äôt like to sleep when the sun is about to set, around after 5Pm, max I‚Äôd go to is 6PM. It is just something I was brought up by not to sleep when the sun is setting is just something cultural; and I kinda abide by it, my family does not enforce it.

2) After I woke up, my Mom and our stay home-helper, decided to go to the nearby mall, which is about 20 mins walk away and along the way they have to pass by a park, so I decide to walk my dog with them till the park, this park in between a block of flats/condos which situated in the center of a big road with fast moving cars. When was about to leash my dog, I decided not to use the chocker for him and use a body harness. I don‚Äôt like the idea of a chocker, however my dad recommended it but I didn‚Äôt heed his advice

My dog is a rather big GR. After reaching the end of the park, my mom and our helped ‚Äújaywalked‚Äù across the road to the mall, which is normal here, and when my GR saw them crossing the road, he decided he wanted to follow them, he pulled me towards the road, and I was able to stop him. And then he decided to sit at the middle of the walkway in the park, this walkway is just few steps from the road. 

I tried to make him walk back home but he decided he wanted to go towards the road, and mind you I am fully grown 30 y/o man, and he was almost overpowering me. 

He just doesn‚Äôt listen to me, he listens to everyone in the house expect me 

I was soo afraid that he would overpower me and run to the road. I tried to carry him but I‚Äôd only carry him for a bit. I was honestly shivering and visibly shivering, I was on the verge of cyring ; I asked a pass by if I‚Äôd borrow his phone where I had to call my dad to come down with the choker. And brought us home

And of course I am blaming my GR. But this incident was the 2nd trigger. I am getting a little anxious as im typing about it.

And I was having some beers that night, and the incident kept replying over and over in my head, I had to force myself not to cry. 

But anws, I am wondering if my current mood is due to these triggers? Or Meds? Or my exercise?

I am assuming it is due to the triggers, if it is, will my mood go back to normal? Today is the 3rd day.

I am supposed to go to therapy, but the nearest appointment I can get is months away, how do I handle my trigger? I am open to any suggestions. 

And if it is not about the triggers, what do I do ?

Thanks everyone!",471

Mirtazapine - how much to knock me out for days,"I‚Äôm from the UK. I‚Äôm  currently on my second day of being on mirtazapine a 30mg dose.After weaning myself of 150mg of sertraline.

"Got off Mirtazapine & Kratom cold turkey, what would you do now? Any experiences or advice?","I just got off Mirtazapine cold turkey like 2 weeks ago. Off Kratom since Friday, 9 December, had a relapse yesterday. I started using Lyrica (Pregabalin) on Sunday, 11 December, to combat and go through the withdrawals. I took it from Sunday to Friday last week. So 5 days in total, mostly 150mg in the morning, two days another 150mg in the evening. It really helped me to still go to work, be able to finish my tasks, and get out of bed or my apartment. I still suffer badly but it's the only thing that really helps me do something, get out of bed, and have way less social anxiety (still shy and introvert but way less antisocial and anxious, more talkative, esp no physical anxiety like shakes anymore). I took it these 5 days, then 2 days off (last Saturday and Sunday), then today again 150mg in the morning + 100mg in the evening as I had a university essay and a presentation today. It helped. I even think about going to the gym now, I managed to eat one whole meal so far, which is great.

My doc even prescribed me lyrica for daily use or whenever i need it but I never have been taking it more than once every one or two weeks as I was and still am horribly anxious about lyricas own dependance and withdrawal that can be bad according to some people. And that using it regularly just makes my condition worse in the end and offers me another bad withdrawal time that puts me even deeper to the ground of deep depression.

As I suffer more than anytime, probably because of withdrawing from Kratom AND Mirtazapine (while I thought Mirtazapine has no severe withdrawal, might also only be the kratom withdrawal), and I don't eat (lost 5kg/10lbs in these 2 weeks), I don't sleep and feel very fucked, insane, can't move much or do anything functional, I was wondering if it would be the best to just go back on Mirtazapine. But otherwise I'm very happy and proud that I got off Mirtazapine and don't have to take it daily anymore. I just don't know what to do. I know lyrica would help me if I continue taking it. But I also know there can be harsh withdrawal for many people who take Lyrica daily. Mirtazapine might have withdrawal, too and maybe I should just use this opportunity to finally get off Mirtazapine (which even didn't help my depression much, did nothing for my social anxiety, BUT it made me eat and sleep which can contribute to improving depression). Mirtazapine is the 14th med Im trying now, without much or any success. Life still has been a daily pain and suffering since trying these meds and 3 different psychotherapies for 5 or more years now.

What would you do in my position? Get on the lyrica train as many do and swear on but also many suffer from withdrawing in the end? Get back on Mirtazapine and hope to be better in one or two weeks, finally eating and sleeping again, and getting back on my weight (I always was skinny but now am really thin cauese of not being able to eat or drink at all).

Also my doc just prescribed me Lithium (as my 15th med to try plus 30mg Mirtazapine - my doc doesnt know that I quit it) on last Monday but as I don't suffer bipolar depression and I couldn't find any information or studies for Lithium being succesful for unipolar depression or social anxiety (which is my biggest source of depression) I just hesistated to take it until now.

Otherwise I also have many supplements left I still wanted to try and had hope that they can be finally ""heal"" me. Lavender extract, Bacopa, Rhodiola Rosea extract, SAM-e, Dopa Mucuna, Lemon Balm, Gotu Kola extract, Magnolia Bark extract, GABA (not bought yet but maybe was thinking of: Kanna, Lions Mane Mushroom, DXM low dose, Polygala, Tongkat Ali?). Can any of these be helpful for my withdrawal and depression and social anxiety even if 14 pharmaceutical meds didn't help?

It's hard to decide which way to go as all of these meds need time to work and I don't have the time or ability to suffer that long until I know if a med or supplement works or if it does not.

* Lithium seems so unuseful for my issues as there are only studies using it for bipolar, but I don't have bipolar depression, still my doc sees a reason why she prescribed it to me, I guess, as next trial after 14 failed meds and 3 failed psychotherapies. I just don't see the reason as there is no science I can find behind it.
* I could take Mirtazapine and I know I'd probably start eating and sleeping again in 1-2 weeks thanks to Mirtazapine but otherwise I think I might get dependent on it (Idk if this is withdrawal from Mirtazapine or Kratom or both, but if it's Mirtazapine too, I'd be better now off of it than prolonging the use and withdrawal of Mirtazapine).
* I surely won't touch Kratom again for a while as I've really been dependent on it, and it just fucks with my mental health after one week daily use and I also don't eat on it to get effects on empty stomach 24/7. It just isn't worth using it daily and I have to take a looong break from it until I can start using it like once a week max. Because I know when I only used it once a week it was effective and giving me good results but daily use just worsens my state a lot.
* I could continue Lyrica, with the very high risk for dependence and withdrawal when trying to quit it one day but I know it works for my social anxiety better than any med before, even if it's only a little lift. Otherwise many use it daily as no other meds worked and they just pay the price for a bit of life quality and one day going off of it with bad withdrawals and maybe long-term damage (?). How's your experience with Lyrica as therapeutical daily use for depression and social anxiety? Ever tried to get off of it? Is it possible or a very bad idea to use it daily even if it's the only thing helping a bit?
* I could try any of the above mentioned supplements I still haven't tried (I tried many others before without success but maybe you have some other supps that helped you with treatment-resistant depression and social anxiety when no other even strong pharmaceutical meds didn't help. but at that point I also think, if strong pharmaceutical meds couldn't help me or treat me right, how could a supplement do?)
* I could ask for another medication than Lithium. I will surely tell my doc that I hesistated to try Lithium until now as I couldn't find any studies on it for my issues anywhere and was overthinking of going on another med again, just failing, having no success and maybe side effects and withdrawal of it for no success or effects in contrary. What meds could I still try if 14 meds didn't work?

I already tried these meds and no one treated my depression and social anxiety, not even touched it except for Mirtazapine enabling me to eat more and sleep better:

* Escitalopram (Cipralex)
* Promethazine
* Venlafaxine (Effexor)
* Quetiapine (Seroquel)
* Sertraline (Zoloft)
* Opipramol
* Paroxetine (Paxil)
* Duoloxetine (Cymbalta)
* Moclobemide (Aurorix) (weakest MAOI)
* Amitriptyline
* Gabapentin
* Diazepam (Valium)
* Mirtazapine (Remeron) => makes me eat and sleep, probably lil effective cause of helping with that
* Bupropion (Wellbutrin)
* Pregabalin (Lyrica) => lil effective

All no success. Plus 2 depth psychological psychotherapies and 1 cognitive behavioral therapy, all failed, too. No success.

Still open to try, some meds I just noted some days I was desperated and surfing through the web for alternatives and relief:

* Ketamine (any experiences? also expensive and hard to find where I live)
* Psilocybin (Magic Mushrooms) (have big anxiety of horror trips and psychosis etc., also illegal here)
* Ayahuasca (maybe in a south american treatment center but hella expensive)
* rTMS or ECT (any experiences? also hard to find)
* Meds I didn't try yet: Tranylcypromin (Parnate, irreversible MAOI, affects both enzymes in comp to Moclobemide), Clomipramine (but serotonergic drug and ssris/snris never worked so far), Lamotrigine (Mood Stabilizer, idk if this would be making sense?), Selegiline (MAO-B-I), Amisulpride (low dose should be effective for social anxiety and drive/energy/anhedonia), Tianeptine (Sulfat/Sodium, but should have a high addiction and withdrawal risks as I heard), Vortioxitine (Serotomodulator/stimulator), Buspirone, Hydroxzine, Risperidone (Mood Stabilizer), Abilify (Add-On, potent. AD one doc I found on youtube swears on being effective for depression for every of his patients he tried it on, maybe antipsychotic worth a try?), Rasagiline (MAO-B-I), Tofisopam, Trimipramine, Doxepine, Milnaneurax, Propranolol, Dopaminergic: Pramipexol, Ropinirol, Mianserine, Maprotiline, ADHD meds (i possibly suffer from ADD and just never got diagnosed it? reason why no meds or therapies worked so far for me as wrong diagnosis?: Atomoxetin, Modafinil, Ritalin, Dexamphetamin, Lisdexamfetamin), other Benzos (Clonazepam, Bromazepam, Alprazolam, Oxazepam)

Any idea what you'd do in my position? Rn I don't eat and just starve all the time, I don't drink, I don't sleep, this is very unhealthy so I have to do something PLUS my horrible depression and social anxiety not enabling me to go out, see friends, just canceling all appointments, dont visit university anymore and probably just have to quit my masters degree and never make real friends or romantic relationships, having no future in sight, while also being cognitively very retared and probably just turned dumb, no skills, no knowledge, just no future and no strengths or anything I could offer anyone - and the anxiety I could never catch up on all these things, skills, knowledge and experience other already have in my age (im 23 now).

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of experience and knowledge to survive in adulthood EVEN IF let's say survive depression and social anxiety itself. I don't know, I surely remember when I first noticed my mental health issues that my deep depression had big impacts on my cognition and joy or ability to learn things. The social anxiety contributed to this ""cogntive performance/ability"" in public of course. Now I don't know if it might have been all the many different meds I tried or the depression or a combination which made me so freaking dumb that kills my hope for being able to live a normal life even if I'd be able to finally ever feel not fucking hellishly depressed and freakingly socially anxious once. These are thoughts like I just dont have learned any skills, any knowledge about any topic or profession, might it just be football, basketball, following it on the TV and knowing about players, I don't know anything about cars or mechanics as some men my age do and makes them somehow ""manly"" for me, I can't play any instrument or don't play any sports in a team, I don't know anything about politics or any science topic. I'm just blank. Only positive I see is that I'm at least a good looking young man, a good looking loser. I feel so unmanly because of not knowing anything about this stuff and have no skills or knowledge I can offer. Makes me suicidal and reducing my self confidence and self worth a lot. I was really often thinking about having ADD (but started only very late or no one rarely urged to test me on this as I have social anxiety and by that surely am not the hyperactive ADHD type - i heard the missing H part is the reason why many ADHD patients get ignored even if the attention deficit disorder is still fully present).

I really have big hopes on meds even if 14 different ones didn't work yet but I don't know how my life could change other than a med, supplement or any substance being finally effective and supporting me cause I tried so much (therapies, diet, sports - they only help a little) and I really think it's just my brain chemistry and it can't get better without any substance helping me... even my new doc said this type of depression and anxiety I have can only be solved by pharmaceutical help or biochemical influence from the outside as so much didn't help me until now and I tried so much.

Sorry for the long text. This makes me see that Lyrica helped me to day with my issues as otherwise I would never have the energy to write so much and not feel bad and just crawl into my bed doing nothing than starving and staring on the wall or trying to sleep and just not feel my horrible feelings of depression, self hate and future anxiety. I really am living unhealthy now, so at this moment I really take even withdrawal of lyrica just to survive. But idk if this is a very bad idea. I try to not take it tomorrow, but maybe I feel so horrible again that I have to at least eat one meal, drink a bit of water, get out and get something done for university or other todos I just skipped for 2 weeks now...",474

Alternating between remeron and seroquel for sleep,"Hey guys, I needed some opinions on alternating between remeron and seroquel for sleep.

About 2 months ago, I tapered off my remeron and didn‚Äôt rely on anything to sleep for about a month. The last month or so, I‚Äôve been alternating between about 25 mg of seroquel and 7.5 mg each night. My question is, is this safe to do, and are these drugs safe long term?

"Remeron, Prozac, Lexapro thoughts","After a stint in the ward due to me calling for worries of actions I couldn't bring her back from, my wife has done remeron for a month. That one was like a full nullification. There just wasn't any sad or happy. Always baseline.

Switched to Prozac. We're just under 2 weeks and got contact with the doctor today to change. This one seemed to honestly help at first. almost instantly. But almost every 5 days was mania like I've never seen before. She was never manic in this regard before. For her it was uncomfortable and I truly believe in listening to her thoughts on the matter and talking it out. We did that the first episode, and settled on letting time happen. Well not this time.

So now weaning off that into Lexapro. 

Guess I'm just curious for anyone's thoughts here on the regiment. Any things to be aware of, general thoughts on what I've described. If you have questions. Please ask. I'll be forthright.

The whole situation with medication is starting to feel like she's further away than when we started and I'm losing confidence on what is better or worse.

For the record, no official diagnoses. She's always had depressive episodes (we're going on 11 years together). Only recently in a place of seeking help for what good it's worth. Overall she's solid.

Medication management worries,"Need some advice here.  
  
After a very bad past 2 months full of nervous breakdowns and panic attacks I've gone through multiple medications from my former psychiatrist. In the past month I've been on:  
  
50mg Sertraline (Up from my usual 7-year-standing 25mg)  
  
40mg Buspar  
  
20mg Propanolol (as needed)  
  
100mg Trazodone (night)  
  
25mg Seroquel (night)  
  
My sleep went from 2-4 hours to 6 which is not great, but was enough of an improvement. My anxiety however still persisted and keeps getting worse and it felt like nothing helped. My former psychiatrist felt like she couldn't help me and recommended I see a psychiatrist that specializes in anxiety and sleep, whom I met with yesterday.  
  
He recommended I get off the Sertraline & Buspar as they're not helping me and replace the Seroquel and Trazodone with Remeron (Mirtazapine). He wants me to slow taper the Sertraline to 25mg for a week and then stop. I explained to him that it's a lot of psych meds to be coming off of at once, and so quickly, and was very worried but he brushed it off saying I was on ""piddling"" doses and it shouldn't matter. He was very cold and distant, especially with how much visible anguish I came into the appointment with.  
  
Last night I took the Remeron with 50mg of Trazodone (I've read enough horror stories of trazodone withdrawal, I'm not going to cold turkey that one). I got tired but just couldn't fall asleep. Another hour later I took 25mg of Trazodone, a melatonin gummy, and finally when another 40 min passed, I caved and took a small amount (10mg) of Seroquel and finally was able to get a bit of sleep.

Has the brain fog not gone away because these other medications can also be inducing brain fog? If you have any information on Risperidone or Mirtzipine, please let me know. I've done some research on them, apparently, Risperidone has an anticholinergic effect. Is this true? And does it matter whether you take it at night or in the morning? Remeron is one I'm not too sure about. It's used for insomnia, at 7.5(mg). Only taken at night, but it's also an antidepressant. How do I feel? How have I been feeling? Well, to try and make it short, I have trouble remembering or recalling, I go blank and forget what I'm talking about in a conversation, and I have a hard time with word finding. I can study new information every day, and yet, still not able to use it in real time. ",482
Seroquel withdrawal 25mg,"I was on Seroquel for 2 years. I was up to 250mg at night. I mostly took it for sleep but also for the antipsychotic effects. I tapered down to 50mg over the course of 5 months. During this time my doctor put me on trazodone to help me sleep but it doesn‚Äôt do much for me. Due to my insurance I have to get off of the Seroquel since I‚Äôm also on Latuda (for psychosis since Seroquel wasn‚Äôt working for it). My doctor and I tapered me from 50 to 25 within 3 days and then I went down to 0 3 days later. 

For this whole past week my sleep has been terrible. We started me on 15mg of remeron. That‚Äôs still not really helping me sleep. My sleep is very shallow and I feel restless when trying to sleep. I don‚Äôt really have any other withdrawal symptoms. Does anyone have any experience and knows how long it will take for sleep to go back to normal?",483
Question about serotonin syndrome,"Just a quick up front - I have been taking Mirtazapine (Remeron)  for over 2 years at this point. About 3 weeks ago, my psychiatrist started me on Hydroxyzine and just last week I received a prescription for Lorazepam (Ativan). Only over the past 2-3 days have I been taking all 3 medications throughout the course of each day. I'm currently taking 15mg Mirtazapine when I wake up around 9am, 25mg Hydroxyzine around noon, .5mg Ativan at 3-4pm, another 25mg Hydroxyzine at 7pm and then 30mg Mirtazapine right before I lay down for sleep around 11pm-midnight. I have also been given 10mg Propranolol to take as needed.

Would that combination of medication at those doses be enough to trigger serotonin syndrome? I've never felt my body acting like it has the past 2 nights. Nausea (have not vomited yet), increased heart rate, noisy gut and diarrhea have been my main symptoms since starting to take all of those meds. When I was just on Mirtazapine, it was great as I almost never dealt with nausea. However, my anxiety has become so severe over the past couple weeks to months that my psychiatrist has prescribed me all of these meds and yet I'm \*still\* dealing with anxiety daily as well as these new symptoms. Does my body just need more time to adjust or am I dealing with serotonin syndrome from being excessively medicated?",484
What the hell is going on with me,"Recently my doctor ripped me of mirtazalpine called remeron. I went from 22.5 mg to 0 in 3 weeks. I also changed from Ativan to klonopin. I feel exhausted, emotionless and irritable. I have no motivation. I don‚Äôt know which change is causing it. If anyone has exp with this please share with me!",485
zero sex drive - permanent?,"This is really hard for me. My partner is being patient but I can tell he's frustrated. I don't feel any kind of sexual desire, and (hope he doesn't see this) I don't even really find him attractive. I like being around him, he makes me laugh and we do stuff and watch tv together, but the attraction is just not there. :'( How do I know if this is permanent or brought on by meds? I don't want to leave him because I don't know if this is really how I feel but ngl if he upped and left me tomorrow I don't think I'd be that upset. And it makes me feel terrible saying that. We've been together 14 years.

I take haloperidol, clozapine, klonopin, and remeron.

Increasing tiredness and inability to think/concentrate,"I just turned 39. I have been diagnosed when I was 17 with social anxiety and in my 20s with general anxiety disorder. 

These last few years have been tough with find I have an addiction for which I've been in a 12 step program for three years and have 17 months sobriety. I'm at a point in life with some big decisions looming I have to make: to get married, have kids, as well as a career change as I 1.) Know this isn't the career I want to continue doing and 2.) My mental health seems to be declining in that I feel incredibly tired and unmotivated as well as having the increased inability to make decisions and get through the day.

While I've had thoughts of harming myself before, I have not attempted suicide recently: I kind of did when I was 17. I have self harm thoughts here and there but currently I don't feel I want to die, rather I feel like I'm at my wits end as far as being able to navigate life currently.

I'm skeptical of antidepressants: I've been on Prozac and Remeron in the past and both had side effects that I felt did not warrant continuing to take them as well as an increased sense of detachment- more that I already experience.

Has anyone dealt with this and if so, how did you navigate this with a mental health professional? I'm in California and have Kaiser and have not liked the psychiatrists I've experienced with them that seemed eager to prescribe medications?

I have a therapist I see and pay out of pocket which has been helpful but I feel like that is not effective currently to what I have going on.

"Strange, terrifying problem I'm having. I'm scared of going to sleep and dreaming.","I've always had an aversion to dreams. I never wanted to have nightmares or dreams. But it never consumed like it has until the last week and a half. Now I'm completely crippled by it. I keep thinking about it, barely eating, can't do anything but think about it. Each night gets worse with every dream I have. I got prescribed remeron (mirtazapine) for the anxiety but I'm afraid to take that too since it is said to cause vivid dreams and nightmares. I just don't know what to do. Just being in bed with my eyes closed sends me into a panic.",488
Recent struggles,"Hello everyone, I am a 28 y.o. W male. I was diagnosed with adhd when I was very young, and i was diagnosed with MDD and PTSD last year around this time. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in the first grade, I‚Äôm sure everyone who has ADHD knows how you were treated in school. Front of the class, constant phone calls home, special treatment, etc‚Ä¶. I didn‚Äôt think about it much until today, when I was listening to an audiobook. 

I was a Detention Officer for 5 years at a local county jail. While I was serving the dinner meals to the inmates behind closed doors, I walked up on a 22 year old kid that hung himself with a bedsheet from his bunk. I suffered pretty hard from the event repeating in my head, nightmares, I was scared to walk upon cell doors, I had to work in the same zone that I found the kid at for six months after the event. 

I ended up hitting rock bottom around this time last year. My lieutenant had to call my wife to pick me up from work. I cried in the sergeants office for an hour. I had called out of work the day before because I had no energy to even get out of bed. All I could do was cry and have these terrible images of seeing myself, or my kids, or someone close to me hanging. My wife took me to see a doctor to start some psychiatric medication. 

I started on Zoloft, did not react well. Next was Prozac, did not react well. Remeron literally made me leave home and want to cut my wrist. I tried many more but the one I am on now is escitalopram20 and buproprion150. 

I am posting today because I struggle with wanting to slow my mind down. It‚Äôs constantly running, today I wanted to give up and go home to my wife. I feel so down and worthless. I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough for my wife. I can‚Äôt find balance at home. I‚Äôm constantly aching. 

I‚Äôm going to start talk therapy soon but I‚Äôm tired of feeling so burnt out. I know my post is vague but I can‚Äôt type forever. I‚Äôll answer any questions!

I‚Äôve been on Ritalin and adderall before but both make my anxiety shoot through the roof. I believe it‚Äôs my adhd that needs to be manages. Looking for advice or something to ease my mind of constant talking. ",489
medication resistance for insomnia,"I have cycled through tens of medications in the past 3 years

the whole nine yards,i have already found the medication that effectively helps my moods but half of my medications have been for sleep,ambien was the ONLY thing that ever put me to sleep but my insurance never covered it because i am a minor and the price just kept going up and up it got to $175 dollars at one point but i dont know what to do,i am trying to schedule a sleep study but theyre months out so what do i do in the meantime ,i feel like i‚Äôve exhausted all options, even the facebook mom approach of reading a book and shit like that,i just hate that i have no energy and theres nothing i can do about it,its progressively getting worse,i went from having trouble staying asleep to now not being able to sleep until my body is literally beginning to lose function,my body will be EXHAUSTED but my brain just goes and goes i wanna rip my hair out",490
"What is this, and how can i overcome it? ","Im 30 years old and just recently had to quit my job, lose my appartment and give everything up and move back in with my parents due to mental health reasons. Agoraphobia, panic disorder, ocd, ptsd, general anxiety disorder and several others. I love both my parents to death but i just can't seem to overcome this. 

I've always felt my mother starring at me but just recently it's been getting unbearable.. It's actually making me go insane and have thoughts of just offing myself. I can't stand being looked at by anyone(strangers, friends, family) let alone stared at constantly. Like i am some kind of science experiment or some strange being that has yet to be discovered or the 8th wonder of the world or something. It's all the time too, when we are watching tv, eating, playing cards, trying to take a nap. I always feel her eyes on me. Like shes staring at me because i have mental problems and she is analyzing me or something. 

I've mentioned it to her a few times and she just gets all defensive like one time she said ""oh boy, here we go"" and other times both my parents were like are we not aloud to look at you. Like i dont get it and its getting out of control. I'm agoraphobic so i don't go outside very often. I'm about to just start locking myself in my room. 

Sometimes i try to stare back at her and she just smiles and raises her eyebrows a couple times. Like she thinks its a fucking game. It's really taking a toll on me and i can't get over it. 

Other's on here and in person have told me to just grow up or stop being selfish, or im just paranoid because of my anxiety.   I was in jail for 7 months when i was 17 then prison from 18-20. I was a manager of a grocery store for 2.5 years before i had a panic attack 8 months ago and got diagnosed with agoraphobia and all my other diagnoses.. Was an ast manager for 4 years before that ( just for some backstory to my life). 


Is there something i can try or do to not worry about it or care about it. Im already on effexor, remeron, clonidine, and losartan. But I'll take another one just to get some type of relief. I don't care if she does stare at me, i just want to be comfortable in my own skin again. Any help or insight is welcome. And i thank you in advance.

First Post. Is my mom right to suggest I go to mental health inpatient for a thyroid issue?,"Hello. I have been going through it with the anxiety a bit the past year. Had 2 panic attacks. A bit moody. Have been seeing a psychiatrist and taking Remeron for about 6 months. And my doctor just ordered bloodwork. Just found out 2 days ago that I have hyperthyroidism. Which can cause anxiety/mood swings. So I texted my mom and my brothers, ""just got blood work done.  I have hyperthyroidism."" Nothing more in the messages. Both of my brothers responded similarly, within an hour, saying, that sucks, hope it is the best possible outcome, love you, let me know if you wanna talk, you're so strong, etc.
My mom on the other hand, did not respond for 2 days. And just now texted me saying, ""This explains some of the mental health things. I feel like an inpatient mental health stay may help you with medication to treat both your physical and mental health symptoms. We love you so much and want you to be healthy and mentally well. Let me know if I can help facilitate getting you help."" 
I have been researching hyperthyroidism non-stop the past 2 days, and heard nothing about inpatient mental health care as a treatment. I was happy to see that maybe we finally found out what was causing my anxiety. My mom's response struck me as weird. And she was just shaming the hell out of me for taking medication. And shaming the hell out of her friend who is doing outpatient mental health for depression. She was telling me about her friend and was all ""bless her heart, she just wants to color? Coloring books at an outpatient facility? Like literally?"" So it makes me feel weird. She definitely shames people for getting mental health help and has to me in the past. Why is she recommended me go to inpatient psychiatric therapy for my hyperthyroidism/anxiety?",492
I can't live any longer like this. I really need help.,"Im 22 and suffering from social anxiety and depression since I was 15. I tried 13 medications now and 3 therapies (2 depth psychological analytical ones, 1 cognitive behavioral one) all without any success or reduction in symptoms. I moved to a new country now and surely I think this was a great step as I can begin from new, as my past is really dark and I experienced many things I dont want to remember, (which I would if I would still be there where I was before), also good to move on from my old contacts and family to be able to start a new life and personality as my old contacts might drain my unconscious mind to my old habits and personality... 

I have a doc appointment tomorrow for trying a new medication as my current one (Mirtazapine 30mg) is another one without any success... Its sadly not a permanent doc as all the ones I got the contact to are in holidays rn. Still I hope she can give me advice for new meds. I also tried going to the gym regularly like every 2nd day and trying keto and carnivore diet but nothing helps. So in conclusion, 13 meds, 3 therapies, regular gym (while it helps a tiny bit) and diet dont help me.

What I tried from meds:

Escitalopram (Cipralex) + Promethazine; Venlafaxine (Effexor) + Quetiapine; Sertraline (Zoloft); Opipramol; Paroxetine (Paxil); Duloxetine (Cymbalta); Moclobemide (Aurorix); Amitriptyline; Gabapentin; Methylfolate; Mirtazapine (Remeron); Diazepam (Valium).

I now want to give my doc a list of meds I still want to try and thought of:

Nefazodon (maybe amplified by Abilify/Aripiprazol or Lamictal/Lamotrigine)

Tranylcypromin (Parnate) (suggested by my old doc as I'm clearly treatment resistant and it could be time for stronger MAOIs as Parnate or Selegilin ‚Äì Moclobemide already tried but without success - Nardil (Phenelzine) is sadly not available in my countrie or near by)

Tianeptine

Agomelatine

Or try again SSRI/SNRI/TCA but I never had luck with them so far so Im very unsure if it would make sense, for example the ones I didnt try yet like: Clomipramine, Vortioxetine, Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), Fluvoxamine (Luvox), Fluoxetine (Prozac)

Otherwise new as needed medication (current one is diazepam but its too weak and short lasting), so maybe: Clonazepam, Lorazepam, Pregabalin, Hydroxizine, Tianeptine, Amisulpride, Propranolol

Or maybe Im just wrongly diagnosed, maybe ADD or some other psychotic illness? As I suffer strongly from ADD symptoms and I already know when I tried Ritalin it reduced my symptoms widely, like amazingly... 

Last resort I would try Ketamine, rTMS, even microdosing mushrooms or LSD or take a trip to a foreign country and do a Ayahuasca therapy... Im really fucked. I cant live any longer like this. What should I do if 13 meds and 3 therapies didnt work, gym doesnt help enough, diet change doesnt do anything? 

So Id be happy if you could help me out somehow or give me answers to:

1. What would you do in my case? 
2. Which meds have helped your social anxiety? What effects or positive changes did you notice from them after how much time?
3. Which meds should I try next (maybe some from my list are accurate?)?

My symptoms are very bad:

\- Social anxiety seems to be one of the main sources of my depression as I: dont leave the house, dont go outside, socially isolate myself, neglect all my colleagues and ""friends"", I wouldnt call them real friends as I neglected them so often and cant be myself when being with them or anyone, even family members or yearlong friends, I cant go out my room when I dont know that a roommate is not in the corridor, so I even skip brushing my teeth sometimes and not going to the loo due to that

\- life is a daily suffering, startin from the moment i open my eyes in the morning to the moment i close them in the night when i try to sleep

\- i have dreadful negative thoughts about my past, present and future, everything seems falling over me, everything seems so bad

\- i have very low self esteem, no self trust

\- moving is hard, eating is hard, drinking is hard

\- my cognition is very bad, like memory and concentration/focus, I feel dumb af and lacking general knowledge

\- no drive, motivation, energy or joy at all, anhedonia and lethargy, lack of drive, no passions, no hobbies i follow anymore

\- etc and a lot more but its already so long",493
On depression - options exhausted,"I‚Äôm diagnosed with treatment resistant, atypical depression. It manifests itself in acute social anxiety, pessimism, self-hatred, exhaustion, and despair about the world‚Äôs and my future. In the past ten years, I have tried:

- 8 long term therapists, including those who work with CBT, DBT, EMDR, groups, Somatic healing, and Buddhist koans
- medications such as Prozac, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Lamictal, two MAOinhibitors at high doses, some adhd related meds, and more
- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (three rounds)
- Mindfulness, Zen, guided, group, and Transcendental meditation
- exposure therapy in the hopes that I gradually feel more comfortable around large groups of strangers
- blood tests for possible thyroid problems
- diet and exercise regimen in a vain attempt to transform into more of an upbeat go-getter
- journaling
- Landmark forum
- psychics and astrologers
- people‚Äôs advice to ‚Äújust relax, be happy, go easy on yourself, might as well enjoy the only life you get‚Äù

None of it has helped. At least not for more than a week or two. And every time I look for articles on struggling to find something effective , they go over the list I just made. The only other things I‚Äôve heard of are ECT and psilocybin trials. The latter are not an option until I wean myself off my MAOinhibitor (Nardil), and my attempts have been quite painful. That‚Äôs my history with antidepressants: if they‚Äôre effective for a little while, that will pass and their only noticeable effect will be anguish if you forget to take them. My doctor doesn‚Äôt want to go for ECT and just assumes that it‚Äôll all work out because of the time 4 years ago when Nardil initially made a difference.

What am I missing?",494
"Just kind of curious if what i'm experiencing in your guys' opinions is like hypomania, or just me feeling better?","I (31m) don't believe I'm bipolar and have never been diagnosed as such. No prior manic or hypomanic episodes. 14 months ago I suddenly had some horribly distressing mental health symptoms overnight. None prior.

For those entire 14 months I have had terrible intrusive harm like OCD thoughts (still do just less), depression, anxiety, dpdr, suicidality, and PTSD. I felt like a 1-3 / 10 low every single day.

I basically played video games all day everyday just to get me through the day.

I've been on Nardil for about 1.5 months, but I went from 60mg to 75mg a week ago. I also started 2.5mg of Abilify a week ago. 

Since then my productivity levels have went much higher. I'm less irritable. My mind has quieted down. I'm able to fall asleep around the same time as I have been going to sleep for a long time now (11:30ish pm), but I'm finding that I'm waking up between 4-7am and not being able to fall back asleep. Partially it feels like because I'm excited to actually be productive after not having been at all for the last year. Seem to be spending more money on like Amazon for a new hobby i've been working on for the last three months, but i also just got a disability benefit payment that was a decent chunk of change. 

In your opinion, does this sound like hypomania, like a side effect to the medications, or perhaps like my mental health symptoms are abating? Not enough info?",495

"Anyone success with Pregabalin, Hydroxizine, Selegiline, Amisulpride, Tianeptine or Lamotrigine for Depression & Social Anxiety?","I‚Äòve tried 13 meds now, all with very little (placebo like) to mostly no effects at all, mostly really zero effects at all, nada, except for side effects.

Gabapentin & Mirtazapine were the ones that had a subtle positive effect on depression and social anxiety.
Escitalopram had a huge effect but lasted only one week (why? Idk as all other SSRI/SNRIs had no effect at all)

Im trying to increasy my mood to more positive, be less anxious about the future, decrease my social anxiety (very important! As its the biggest source of my depression) and with this get more social, talkative and outgoing. I socially isolate myself very much and I think every human needs socializing to be happy (friends as well as romance) and experience stuff, go out.

I‚Äòd be very happy if you could abswer me following questions:

Has any of you experience with any of the named substances (Pregabalin, Hydroxizine, Selegiline, Amisulpride, Tianeptine or Lamotrigine)?

What have been your experiences with each for depression and especially interesting Social Anxiety?

What would you describe the effects like regarding mood/depression, future anxiety, social anxiety/sociability/talkativeness, energy/lethargy, cognition (memory, focus) & anhedonia?

How long does it take until it starts showing significant effects? Or can it be taken on only as needed (work right away after first pill, looking more for this as I don‚Äòt want to take any other med daily but rather only on occasion/if needed).

But having tried a number of medications, I don‚Äôt know what to try next as SSRIs I‚Äôm done with, SNRIs I‚Äôm done with, have only tried one Tricyclic, Irreversible MAOIs are incredibly difficult to get on the NHS in the UK - but I would try them if they could help, just don‚Äôt know how easy it would be to get a prescription.

Treatment resistant depression: what meds can I still give a try?,"Im 22 and have been suffering from severe depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. I tried 2 depth psychological therapies, one behavioral one and over 13 different meds (SSRI, SNRI, atypical, tetracyclic, moclobemide, neuroleptics) without any success. Nothing helped.

Im on Mirtazapine now and while its the only one that had a tiny bit effect at least (better sleep, better appetite) I still suffer a lot daily. I got on it after long break of ADs as my doc told me its very low-risk and she was right, at least regarding side effects (Idk about possible withdrawal) which I dont have any, except for sleepiness after I take it and increased appetite, but I welcome that as I had bad insomnia and sleep issues and Im very skinny.

So I was wondering if I just give a new med I never tried before a try or try the Mirtazapine + another med as a combo. Im really desperate and just started a new job I really like and dont want to lose, but in my condition right now I cant keep it up any longer if I dont improve mentally. I also registred for the gym and changed my diet, but Im still depressed and anxious af. Also my cognition is very bad.

Is there any antidepressant that has low risks for side effects and withdrawal that you could recommend me? Im adding the list of my tried antidepressants below so you have an overview. Thinking about Clomipramine, Vortioxetine, Tranylcypromine, Selegiline or just simple Wellbutrin (tried once but gave up after 1 week as I was having bad anxiety, now I know it was probably due to my at that time Phenibut withdrawal)

* Sertraline (Zoloft)

By that it kills my self esteem, future perspectives and mood/will to live longer. These were just some examples but all the restrictions you can think of caused by SAD are big contributors to my depression & self esteem. 

Im on Mirtazapine now and while its the only one that had a tiny bit effect at least (better sleep, better appetite) I still suffer a lot of daily pain from the moment I open my eyes in the morning to the moment when I close my eyes and lay in be to sleep. I got on Mirtazapine after long break of ADs as my doc told me its very low-risk and she was right, at least regarding side effects (Idk about possible withdrawal) which I dont have any, except for sleepiness after I take it and increased appetite, but I welcome that as I had bad insomnia and sleep issues and Im very skinny.

So I was wondering if I just give a new med I never tried before a try or try the Mirtazapine + another med as a combo. Im really desperate and just started a new job I really like and dont want to lose, but in my condition right now I cant keep it up any longer if I dont improve mentally. I also registred for the gym and changed my diet, but Im still depressed and anxious af. Also my cognition is very bad, almost dumb, many people ask me if I have ADHD because of my bad focus and memory. 

Side info: I always wanted to test for ADHD as Methylphenidate (tried of a friend) improved my symptoms significantly but my previous docs didn‚Äòt want to test me for ADHD (in my case rather ADD) 1. before my depression/anxiety isn‚Äòt treated as these two can be the cause of ADHD symptoms and 2. because one needs to be diagnosed for AD(H)D in his childhood for treatment. So I just thought I‚Äòd never be able to get test or treatment for ADD (which I really fell like having in addition to the depression and social anxiety).

Is there any antidepressant that has low risks for side effects and withdrawal that you could recommend me? Im adding the list of my tried antidepressants below so you have an overview. 

Meds to try next I was Thinking about:
Nefazodone
Clomipramine
Vortioxetine
Tranylcypromine (Parnate)
Selegiline 
Prozac (Fluoxetine - Idk surely as no serotonergic worked so far)
Lamotrigine (or any other antipsychotics, because maybe I‚Äòm wrongly diagnosed as all these 13 meds of antidepressants I tried didn‚Äòt work)
Wellbutrin (tried once but gave up after 1 week as I was having bad anxiety, so quit but maybe I just need more time?)


Meds I already tried:
* Cipralex (Escitalopram) + Promethazine
* Venlafaxine (Effexor) + Quetiapine (Seroquel)
* Sertraline (Zoloft)
* Opipramol
* Paroxetine (Paxil)
* Duloxetine (Cymbalta)
* Moclobemide (Aurorix)
* Amitriptyline
* Gabapentin
* Mirtazapine
* Diazepam (Valium)

I‚Äòm trying to find a new doc at the place I now moved to (new country) so I want to give him a list of meds I‚Äòd like to try next that could be finally potentially helping me more than my previous ones when I visit him, so very thankful for any help, suggestions or recommendations.",500
I can't live any longer like this. I really need help.,"Im 22 and suffering from social anxiety and depression since I was 15. I tried 13 medications now and 3 therapies (2 depth psychological analytical ones, 1 cognitive behavioral one) all without any success or reduction in symptoms. I moved to a new country now and surely I think this was a great step as I can begin from new, as my past is really dark and I experienced many things I dont want to remember, (which I would if I would still be there where I was before), also good to move on from my old contacts and family to be able to start a new life and personality as my old contacts might drain my unconscious mind to my old habits and personality... 

I have a doc appointment tomorrow for trying a new medication as my current one (Mirtazapine 30mg) is another one without any success... Its sadly not a permanent doc as all the ones I got the contact to are in holidays rn. Still I hope she can give me advice for new meds. I also tried going to the gym regularly like every 2nd day and trying keto and carnivore diet but nothing helps. So in conclusion, 13 meds, 3 therapies, regular gym (while it helps a tiny bit) and diet dont help me.

What I tried from meds:

Escitalopram (Cipralex) + Promethazine; Venlafaxine (Effexor) + Quetiapine; Sertraline (Zoloft); Opipramol; Paroxetine (Paxil); Duloxetine (Cymbalta); Moclobemide (Aurorix); Amitriptyline; Gabapentin; Methylfolate; Mirtazapine (Remeron); Diazepam (Valium).

I now want to give my doc a list of meds I still want to try and thought of:

Nefazodon (maybe amplified by Abilify/Aripiprazol or Lamictal/Lamotrigine)

Tranylcypromin (Parnate) (suggested by my old doc as I'm clearly treatment resistant and it could be time for stronger MAOIs as Parnate or Selegilin ‚Äì Moclobemide already tried but without success - Nardil (Phenelzine) is sadly not available in my countrie or near by)

Tianeptine

Agomelatine

Or try again SSRI/SNRI/TCA but I never had luck with them so far so Im very unsure if it would make sense, for example the ones I didnt try yet like: Clomipramine, Vortioxetine, Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), Fluvoxamine (Luvox), Fluoxetine (Prozac)

Otherwise new as needed medication (current one is diazepam but its too weak and short lasting), so maybe: Clonazepam, Lorazepam, Pregabalin, Hydroxizine, Tianeptine, Amisulpride, Propranolol

Or maybe Im just wrongly diagnosed, maybe ADD or some other psychotic illness? As I suffer strongly from ADD symptoms and I already know when I tried Ritalin it reduced my symptoms widely, like amazingly... 

Last resort I would try Ketamine, rTMS, even microdosing mushrooms or LSD or take a trip to a foreign country and do a Ayahuasca therapy... Im really fucked. I cant live any longer like this. What should I do if 13 meds and 3 therapies didnt work, gym doesnt help enough, diet change doesnt do anything? 

So Id be happy if you could help me out somehow or give me answers to:

1. What would you do in my case? 
2. Which meds have helped your social anxiety? What effects or positive changes did you notice from them after how much time?
3. Which meds should I try next (maybe some from my list are accurate?)?

My symptoms are very bad:

\- Social anxiety seems to be one of the main sources of my depression as I: dont leave the house, dont go outside, socially isolate myself, neglect all my colleagues and ""friends"", I wouldnt call them real friends as I neglected them so often and cant be myself when being with them or anyone, even family members or yearlong friends, I cant go out my room when I dont know that a roommate is not in the corridor, so I even skip brushing my teeth sometimes and not going to the loo due to that

\- life is a daily suffering, startin from the moment i open my eyes in the morning to the moment i close them in the night when i try to sleep

\- i have dreadful negative thoughts about my past, present and future, everything seems falling over me, everything seems so bad

\- i have very low self esteem, no self trust

\- moving is hard, eating is hard, drinking is hard

\- my cognition is very bad, like memory and concentration/focus, I feel dumb af and lacking general knowledge

\- no drive, motivation, energy or joy at all, anhedonia and lethargy, lack of drive, no passions, no hobbies i follow anymore

\- etc and a lot more but its already so long",501
"Got off Mirtazapine & Kratom cold turkey, what would you do now? Any experiences or advice?","I just got off Mirtazapine cold turkey like 2 weeks ago. Off Kratom since Friday, 9 December, had a relapse yesterday. I started using Lyrica (Pregabalin) on Sunday, 11 December, to combat and go through the withdrawals. I took it from Sunday to Friday last week. So 5 days in total, mostly 150mg in the morning, two days another 150mg in the evening. It really helped me to still go to work, be able to finish my tasks, and get out of bed or my apartment. I still suffer badly but it's the only thing that really helps me do something, get out of bed, and have way less social anxiety (still shy and introvert but way less antisocial and anxious, more talkative, esp no physical anxiety like shakes anymore). I took it these 5 days, then 2 days off (last Saturday and Sunday), then today again 150mg in the morning + 100mg in the evening as I had a university essay and a presentation today. It helped. I even think about going to the gym now, I managed to eat one whole meal so far, which is great.

My doc even prescribed me lyrica for daily use or whenever i need it but I never have been taking it more than once every one or two weeks as I was and still am horribly anxious about lyricas own dependance and withdrawal that can be bad according to some people. And that using it regularly just makes my condition worse in the end and offers me another bad withdrawal time that puts me even deeper to the ground of deep depression.

As I suffer more than anytime, probably because of withdrawing from Kratom AND Mirtazapine (while I thought Mirtazapine has no severe withdrawal, might also only be the kratom withdrawal), and I don't eat (lost 5kg/10lbs in these 2 weeks), I don't sleep and feel very fucked, insane, can't move much or do anything functional, I was wondering if it would be the best to just go back on Mirtazapine. But otherwise I'm very happy and proud that I got off Mirtazapine and don't have to take it daily anymore. I just don't know what to do. I know lyrica would help me if I continue taking it. But I also know there can be harsh withdrawal for many people who take Lyrica daily. Mirtazapine might have withdrawal, too and maybe I should just use this opportunity to finally get off Mirtazapine (which even didn't help my depression much, did nothing for my social anxiety, BUT it made me eat and sleep which can contribute to improving depression). Mirtazapine is the 14th med Im trying now, without much or any success. Life still has been a daily pain and suffering since trying these meds and 3 different psychotherapies for 5 or more years now.

What would you do in my position? Get on the lyrica train as many do and swear on but also many suffer from withdrawing in the end? Get back on Mirtazapine and hope to be better in one or two weeks, finally eating and sleeping again, and getting back on my weight (I always was skinny but now am really thin cauese of not being able to eat or drink at all).

Also my doc just prescribed me Lithium (as my 15th med to try plus 30mg Mirtazapine - my doc doesnt know that I quit it) on last Monday but as I don't suffer bipolar depression and I couldn't find any information or studies for Lithium being succesful for unipolar depression or social anxiety (which is my biggest source of depression) I just hesistated to take it until now.

Otherwise I also have many supplements left I still wanted to try and had hope that they can be finally ""heal"" me. Lavender extract, Bacopa, Rhodiola Rosea extract, SAM-e, Dopa Mucuna, Lemon Balm, Gotu Kola extract, Magnolia Bark extract, GABA (not bought yet but maybe was thinking of: Kanna, Lions Mane Mushroom, DXM low dose, Polygala, Tongkat Ali?). Can any of these be helpful for my withdrawal and depression and social anxiety even if 14 pharmaceutical meds didn't help?

It's hard to decide which way to go as all of these meds need time to work and I don't have the time or ability to suffer that long until I know if a med or supplement works or if it does not.

* Lithium seems so unuseful for my issues as there are only studies using it for bipolar, but I don't have bipolar depression, still my doc sees a reason why she prescribed it to me, I guess, as next trial after 14 failed meds and 3 failed psychotherapies. I just don't see the reason as there is no science I can find behind it.
* I could take Mirtazapine and I know I'd probably start eating and sleeping again in 1-2 weeks thanks to Mirtazapine but otherwise I think I might get dependent on it (Idk if this is withdrawal from Mirtazapine or Kratom or both, but if it's Mirtazapine too, I'd be better now off of it than prolonging the use and withdrawal of Mirtazapine).
* I surely won't touch Kratom again for a while as I've really been dependent on it, and it just fucks with my mental health after one week daily use and I also don't eat on it to get effects on empty stomach 24/7. It just isn't worth using it daily and I have to take a looong break from it until I can start using it like once a week max. Because I know when I only used it once a week it was effective and giving me good results but daily use just worsens my state a lot.
* I could continue Lyrica, with the very high risk for dependence and withdrawal when trying to quit it one day but I know it works for my social anxiety better than any med before, even if it's only a little lift. Otherwise many use it daily as no other meds worked and they just pay the price for a bit of life quality and one day going off of it with bad withdrawals and maybe long-term damage (?). How's your experience with Lyrica as therapeutical daily use for depression and social anxiety? Ever tried to get off of it? Is it possible or a very bad idea to use it daily even if it's the only thing helping a bit?
* I could try any of the above mentioned supplements I still haven't tried (I tried many others before without success but maybe you have some other supps that helped you with treatment-resistant depression and social anxiety when no other even strong pharmaceutical meds didn't help. but at that point I also think, if strong pharmaceutical meds couldn't help me or treat me right, how could a supplement do?)
* I could ask for another medication than Lithium. I will surely tell my doc that I hesistated to try Lithium until now as I couldn't find any studies on it for my issues anywhere and was overthinking of going on another med again, just failing, having no success and maybe side effects and withdrawal of it for no success or effects in contrary. What meds could I still try if 14 meds didn't work?

I already tried these meds and no one treated my depression and social anxiety, not even touched it except for Mirtazapine enabling me to eat more and sleep better:

* Escitalopram (Cipralex)
* Promethazine
* Venlafaxine (Effexor)
* Quetiapine (Seroquel)
* Sertraline (Zoloft)
* Opipramol
* Paroxetine (Paxil)
* Duoloxetine (Cymbalta)
* Moclobemide (Aurorix) (weakest MAOI)
* Amitriptyline
* Gabapentin
* Diazepam (Valium)
* Mirtazapine (Remeron) => makes me eat and sleep, probably lil effective cause of helping with that
* Bupropion (Wellbutrin)
* Pregabalin (Lyrica) => lil effective

All no success. Plus 2 depth psychological psychotherapies and 1 cognitive behavioral therapy, all failed, too. No success.

Still open to try, some meds I just noted some days I was desperated and surfing through the web for alternatives and relief:

* Ketamine (any experiences? also expensive and hard to find where I live)
* Psilocybin (Magic Mushrooms) (have big anxiety of horror trips and psychosis etc., also illegal here)
* Ayahuasca (maybe in a south american treatment center but hella expensive)
* rTMS or ECT (any experiences? also hard to find)
* Meds I didn't try yet: Tranylcypromin (Parnate, irreversible MAOI, affects both enzymes in comp to Moclobemide), Clomipramine (but serotonergic drug and ssris/snris never worked so far), Lamotrigine (Mood Stabilizer, idk if this would be making sense?), Selegiline (MAO-B-I), Amisulpride (low dose should be effective for social anxiety and drive/energy/anhedonia), Tianeptine (Sulfat/Sodium, but should have a high addiction and withdrawal risks as I heard), Vortioxitine (Serotomodulator/stimulator), Buspirone, Hydroxzine, Risperidone (Mood Stabilizer), Abilify (Add-On, potent. AD one doc I found on youtube swears on being effective for depression for every of his patients he tried it on, maybe antipsychotic worth a try?), Rasagiline (MAO-B-I), Tofisopam, Trimipramine, Doxepine, Milnaneurax, Propranolol, Dopaminergic: Pramipexol, Ropinirol, Mianserine, Maprotiline, ADHD meds (i possibly suffer from ADD and just never got diagnosed it? reason why no meds or therapies worked so far for me as wrong diagnosis?: Atomoxetin, Modafinil, Ritalin, Dexamphetamin, Lisdexamfetamin), other Benzos (Clonazepam, Bromazepam, Alprazolam, Oxazepam)

Any idea what you'd do in my position? Rn I don't eat and just starve all the time, I don't drink, I don't sleep, this is very unhealthy so I have to do something PLUS my horrible depression and social anxiety not enabling me to go out, see friends, just canceling all appointments, dont visit university anymore and probably just have to quit my masters degree and never make real friends or romantic relationships, having no future in sight, while also being cognitively very retared and probably just turned dumb, no skills, no knowledge, just no future and no strengths or anything I could offer anyone - and the anxiety I could never catch up on all these things, skills, knowledge and experience other already have in my age (im 23 now).

I feel like I've missed out on a lot of experience and knowledge to survive in adulthood EVEN IF let's say survive depression and social anxiety itself. I don't know, I surely remember when I first noticed my mental health issues that my deep depression had big impacts on my cognition and joy or ability to learn things. The social anxiety contributed to this ""cogntive performance/ability"" in public of course. Now I don't know if it might have been all the many different meds I tried or the depression or a combination which made me so freaking dumb that kills my hope for being able to live a normal life even if I'd be able to finally ever feel not fucking hellishly depressed and freakingly socially anxious once. These are thoughts like I just dont have learned any skills, any knowledge about any topic or profession, might it just be football, basketball, following it on the TV and knowing about players, I don't know anything about cars or mechanics as some men my age do and makes them somehow ""manly"" for me, I can't play any instrument or don't play any sports in a team, I don't know anything about politics or any science topic. I'm just blank. Only positive I see is that I'm at least a good looking young man, a good looking loser. I feel so unmanly because of not knowing anything about this stuff and have no skills or knowledge I can offer. Makes me suicidal and reducing my self confidence and self worth a lot. I was really often thinking about having ADD (but started only very late or no one rarely urged to test me on this as I have social anxiety and by that surely am not the hyperactive ADHD type - i heard the missing H part is the reason why many ADHD patients get ignored even if the attention deficit disorder is still fully present).

I really have big hopes on meds even if 14 different ones didn't work yet but I don't know how my life could change other than a med, supplement or any substance being finally effective and supporting me cause I tried so much (therapies, diet, sports - they only help a little) and I really think it's just my brain chemistry and it can't get better without any substance helping me... even my new doc said this type of depression and anxiety I have can only be solved by pharmaceutical help or biochemical influence from the outside as so much didn't help me until now and I tried so much.

Sorry for the long text. This makes me see that Lyrica helped me to day with my issues as otherwise I would never have the energy to write so much and not feel bad and just crawl into my bed doing nothing than starving and staring on the wall or trying to sleep and just not feel my horrible feelings of depression, self hate and future anxiety. I really am living unhealthy now, so at this moment I really take even withdrawal of lyrica just to survive. But idk if this is a very bad idea. I try to not take it tomorrow, but maybe I feel so horrible again that I have to at least eat one meal, drink a bit of water, get out and get something done for university or other todos I just skipped for 2 weeks now...",502
Your experience with quetiapine?,"Last day my therapist added quetiapine to my therapy, mostly for my mood swings which happens every 2-3 hours, and for my BPD, also for my overthinking and overanalysing, so I have this anxious way of thinking. What do you think will quetiapine and when will help?",503
Quetiapine withdrawal,"I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I'm afraid that it was mistaken with bpd or something else. I learned a lot about it and the symptoms dont really match me. 
Anyway I got prescribed quetiapine and side effects are killing me. The most annoying one is how difficult it is to think. Any deep thinking is almost impossible and when I try to do it I'm getting very nauseous. 
I just started taking it, first day I took 50mg, then 100mg, 200mg and 300mg. After I took 300mg I immediately went back to 200mg. It's my second day taking 200mg and i was told by my psychiatrist to take 100mg for next two days and later 50mg until i will feel ok, then stop taking it. 
I heard a lot about how hard it is to stop taking quetiapine and I want to know what withdrawal symptoms I need to expect. I didn't saw anyone taking it for such a short period of time. 
Also will it have any effect on my brain after I stop taking it? Maybe stupid question but I saw some horror stories about it and just want to make sure.
I did not make it to ask my psychiatrist about it, but after she told me that the only side effect may be increased heart rate, I don't fukcing trust her. 

Sorry for mistakes, engilsh is not my first language.",504
Seroquel/Quetiapine for depression?,"I tried to search for people‚Äôs experiences and accounts on Seroquel on here but they all seem to be in the context of psychosis, bipolar, etc. but none for depression. My pcp prescribed 50mg ER to me specifically for depression which I am diagnosed with, but with the idea that I *may* have a personality disorder. I took it for the first time and the side effects were INSTANT, I fell asleep for four hours and then woke up snacking a ton. As I mentioned I searched reddit for accounts on taking Seroquel and they vary so much, but what I HAVE heard is mostly negative‚Ä¶ very, very negative. Has anyone else been prescribed this specifically for depression? Should I be worried? What has your experience been?",505
Insomnia and Quetiapine,"Hello everyone, I don't want to make this too long but I was diagnosed with social anxiety and they prescribed Risperidone 2mg, Escitalopram 20mg and Clonazepam 2mg, the thing is that I decided to stop the medication progressively and I felt better and even happy (I came to feel that I finally had my personality) but this only lasted 3 months, in the 4th month I started to have insomnia and I contacted the psychiatrist who prescribed me Quetiapine 200 mg, risperidone curiously never made me gain weight but it did inhibit my personality a little and I was becoming more introverted, I had experience with Olanzapine and it was a disaster with social phobia and intrusive thoughts. I understand that Quetiapine makes me fat just like Risperidone, although the latter did not make me fat, I am afraid that Quetiapine will make me fat and I am also afraid of losing my personality and having social phobia again. But I can't continue like this, I haven't slept for 1 month and 2 weeks, any advice?",506
Am I becoming dependant of Quetiapine,"I have trouble sleeping so my Dr prescribed me 25mg Quetiapine. I've been taking it for about 1-2 weeks I usually try to take it every night 7pm-9pm. I usually try my best to take it as early as possible so 7pm. I've noticed if I forget to take it, around 9-10 I begin to have a bad headache and I feel like I'm spacing out a bit. I'm not sure if it's related or just a coincidence. Has my body began to become dependent of the medicine? Are the headaches caused because I didn't take it for the day and my body needs it? I know I'm not the healthiest person I definitely need to be drinking more water and it's summer so I'm not sure if I'm just dehydrated but it seems like the medicine is somewhat the cause. ",507
quetiapine(Seroquel) hangover,"I wake up like a zombie , I workout in morning and the zombie fatigue is making it hard to do it. I am on 300 mg and I dont know what to, Seroquel has helped me function at least at basic level but I need a solution to this zombie fatigue in the morning, so that I can wake up freshen up and hit the gym with full on pump",508
Quetiapine nightmares?,"I have been prescribed quetiapine as need for insomnia. In the past I used it quite a bit for insomnia and anxiety and found it quite effective. However,  it stopped working as effectively and I quit taking it over a year ago. Then I was prescribed it again last month because Urgent Care won‚Äôt prescribe benzos. I noticed when I have taken it in the last month, I tend to have very vivid dreams, so I have been avoiding it. However, last night I just couldn‚Äôt get to sleep, so I took half a tablet. I fell asleep pretty quickly, but WTF‚Ä¶I just had the most disturbing nightmare! I dreamt that I had a huge fight with my wife and she told me that she didn‚Äôt want to see me again! It was so vivid that it was indistinguishable from reality. When I woke up next to my wife, it took me a few minutes to realize that we didn‚Äôt really fight and it was all just a dream. The only thing that I can think of was the quetiapine that I took. But why did it work so well for all these years, but now it gives me vivid nightmares?",509
Quetiapine / Seroquel,"Started taking 25mg since spring 2021 (was upped to 50mg February 2022) but I can see since then I‚Äôve lost an unbelievable amount of weight ‚Ä¶ Even though I eat loads (way more than before taking this drug)

Escitalopram and quetiapine: is it normal not crying as a side effect?,"Hi, guys I've been taking escitatopram and quetiapine for about 6 months now. And one thing is bothering me, I'm not crying. Is not that I want to feel sad, but I went through a very big disappointment and is something that I should be crying about, but I'm not. Crying is something that really makes me relieved sometimes and I just think that if I was able to cry a bit over that situation I would feel better. So, my question is does this medication I'm taking (escitalopram and quetipiane) has some influence in my ""inhibited emotions""?",511
quetiapine weight gain,"hi!
I started taking serqual 25 miligram one year ago, and slowly raised the dosage so now im at 50 mg regular and taking a 100 mg xr (slow release)
i take it for extreme mood swings, very bad anxiety, intrusive and obsessive thoughts, insomnia and depression
it has helped i think, but unfortunately ever since i upped ny dosage ive been starting to gain weight, eating exactly what i used to.
i always had really fast metabolism and could eat whatever and stay skinny, but now i have to watch my calorie intake all the time
i model, so besides making my body image worse, its a problem with my line of work- I haven't worked in a month because i had to take time and diet
anybody else encountered that issue? its like my metabolism slowed down..

any other pills i can ask my doctor for that dont have that side effect but still work like quetiapine? 
specifically ones that help insomnia, im starting university and without my pill i can be up for 2-3 days in a row, unable to sleep",512
Quitting Quetiapine,"So i was put on 50mg ER Quetiapine every night for the last 2 months as I couldn‚Äôt sleep properly. It‚Äôs purely for insomnia. It‚Äôs helped in the beginning, but now I‚Äôm on other medications (CBD/THC oil, THC vapes night and day and CBD roll on) both for sleep and chronic pain. Over the past month or so, my neck pain has been getting worse especially when I sleep because Quetiapine knocks me out so much that my body doesn‚Äôt even arouse itself when I need to change positions naturally. The drowsiness also got too much, especially since I have to care for a really high energy toddler. I recently talked to my doctor and she said to taper off to 25mg for a week and completely quit, but i‚Äôm super scared of this, especially because tomorrow I start a new job and i‚Äôve heard that coming off can be quite a nightmare. I really can‚Äôt risk losing this job, and need to be my best self. At the same time, being on this drug prohibits me from doing so. When I talked to my Cannabis doctor, they mentioned that once I get the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù of the CBD/THC oil, i‚Äôll be able to get off Quetiapine quite easily. My question is, for those who also take Cannabis (black market, recreational or prescribed) and quetiapine, what should I do to get off quetiapine without weird withdrawals? I haven‚Äôt been vaping the day cart because with quetiapine I get even drowsier in the morning. So i‚Äôm thinking maybe once i‚Äôm off it, i‚Äôll have to start doing the day vapes and titrate my oil a bit more? I‚Äôm really lost here. I can‚Äôt consult with my doctors until mid July.",513
Quetiapine/Seroquel weight gain,"I‚Äôve been on Quetiapine since March/April of 2022, and I‚Äôm now on day 3 of not taking it at all (slowly reduced the dose with my mental health nurse). 
I gained a TONNE of weight on it, I‚Äôm naturally under weight, it‚Äôs not in my genes to be overweight and I‚Äôd get full REALLY easily prior to March 2022.
Will I go back to the way I was before starting the medication? How fast does weight loss happen after stopping taking it? What have been your experiences with it? 
I‚Äôve never had to worry about my weight and I have a lot of stretch marks and I just want my body to go back to the way it was before I started it. It‚Äôs really opened my eyes to how difficult some of the side effects of anti-psychotics and I have a shit tonne of empathy for anyone experiencing the same thing!
Thanks in advance :)",514
Anyone had any experience with Quetiapine?,"Hello, I've just started taking 25mg Quetiapine, which is a super low dose I know, however it's been making me REALLY sleepy. It helps me to sleep in the night, knocks me out pretty quickly, but it's making me so tired during the day. I'm off work at the minute and today I didn't get up till 1pm, and then by 2pm I was asleep for another two hours. Woke up from that and still feel absolutely fucked. 

Has anyone else had similar issues? Does it pass eventually or am I stuck feeling like a zombie? Any help/advice would be appreciated.",515
pregabalin with quetiapine,"Hi! 7 days ago I started both medications - pregabalin twice a day 75mg and quetiapine 50mg twice a day. Im not sure why quetiapine has to be twice a day since its a sedative, hmm. I take it at midnight wake up fresh as a daisy after 12 hrs of sleep, take morning dose and after one hr start to slow down and feel drowsy ,need to sit or lie down, feeling pretty paralysed for next 4 hrs or so (so basically whole afternoon) and fall asleep for anything between 30 min to few hrs. it's starting to bother me as I cant get anything done.

Quetiapine and uteruses,"Late period quetiapine/seroquel

Hi I'm not sure if the correct place to post but I'm looking some advice cause my brain is starting to go haywire with theories. Long story short I've a roughly 4/5 day late period, all pregnancy test negative and I'm just wondering if anyone else's periods have been affected by seroquel/qutiapine.

I'm on a dosage of 50mg in the morning and 150mg at night. I've tried googling but there's a lot of contradicting advice and to be honest I end up scaring myself with all the other reasons it might not be here it's setting my hypochondria of to high noon and my keyworker acts like it's not a big deal when to me it is.

I've being on Quetiapine now for 4 years and not once have I noticed me spitting blood while on this medication increases my dose by 50mgs and for the last few weeks I spit blood during the middle of the night or during the day randomly is this normal or should I be concerned üòü I don't know what to do.",521
Does quetiapine/seroquel actually help,"My doctors think I'm bipolar, I experience psychosis episodes so they have put me on quetiapine and melatonin (I live in the UK so u need prescriptions for those) but I don't know if it's actually helping I've only been on them for about a week so I hope it's just my body getting use to them

I'm on the lowest dose and in 6 weeks they want to up it but I just feel empty with no thoughts and depressed and tired all the fucking time I sleep though 10 alarms and can hardly get out of bed or function normally although I was more erratic and was seeing and hearing things when off them but I'm still seeing stuff and having bad thoughts I don't know if it's actually helping at all",522
"Quetiapine fumarate, how long do side effects last?","I've been dealing with mental health issues for a long time in my life.  Mainly depression and anxiety.  They both come and go in various strenghts and various times.  

Recently I've been tired of the battle and went to my doctor to get some help.  He referred me to a psychiatrist, who prescribed me Quetiapine fumarate.  I've had the pills since the beginning of April but had not taken them as I wasn't sure they were right for me.  Im not a pill person, I have a hard time accepting that a pill will make me better.  However Ive heard that if youve been offered help, its your obligation to take the help, because after all what the hell do i know? And what makes me think i know any better? Anyway, after about six weeks of deliberation with myself, I decided to start. 

 I took my first pill at 8pm night three days ago.  Since then I've had an increase in anxiousness (I can't seem to sit still or have butterfly like symptoms just not in my stomach), and a hug increase in my irritability and anger (I feel angry all the time now so much worse than before, and it seems to be worse with each day).

I cannot get ahold of the psychiatrist who prescribed it until Tuesday (today is sunday) at the earliest.  Its a long weekend in Canada right now.  

I am considering stopping.  I don't know if this is right for me.  But I don't want to screw myself up further.  

So...... if you've read this, know the medication, maybe you can add some insight.  Do these side effects stop or will they get worse?",523

venlaxafine and seroquel,"hey everyone so basically ive been on venlafaxine since i was 17 (im almost 20) and about a year ago I was prescribed seroquel because Im a major cannabis user and I had lost access to smoking and I was losing my mind. ever since, I really liked the combo. I started smoking weed again shortly after though lol. I felt amazingly confident, I was doing things I never thought I would be able to do, I was a lot more social, and I was motivated throughout my day. Then, I started noticing how much weight it had made me gain due to the munchies it gives you at night. I swear I could eat my entire pantry, I would literally wake up with crumbs all over me and i completely would forget all about it. I am an athlete and I do track and honestly it didnt become a problem until about a month later, so i stopped taking it. Fast forward 3 months and I am getting my wisdom teeth removed and obviously you know you cannot smoke weed for a while and edibles dont work for me. I started losing my mind again so I went back on the seroquel. I have had trouble getting off of it for the next 9 months and I had gained 30 pounds. I decided to stop taking it cold turkey (tapering off of it wasnt working) and the withdrawl symptoms are horrible but I have managed to lose all of the weight but my mood is nowhere as good as it was. I also can not sleep at night and I really do not know what to do. My doctor says to go back on it or try another drug called latuda but I am so afraid of gaining back the weight that i worked so hard to lose. Maybe I can manage and I can actually watch what I eat this time knowing how these drugs affect your appetite? or should I continue dealing with my emotions instead of relying on antipsychotics?",532

Serious memory issues with Seroquel (or Sertraline?),"About 4 years ago, I had a first and very difficult episode (words cannot describe it).

I was not on medication before that, but got put on seroquel and sertraline. Weight went from 170ish pounds to 280ish in 2 years (presumably from the medication); since then i've maintained it the weight by tapering the medication down (but not quitting it); but not able to lose weight.

Equally if not more difficult, I have had a really difficult time with my memory since (and I'm doing a PhD of all things). I will read something and forget what I read all the time. I will tell myself I will do something and forget. With hard work and organization, I am able to do my PhD, which is really the only thing I focus on.

Despite all this, I want to stay on the medication. Could my difficulty with memory be due to the medication? Is it worth it to change medications?

is this normal when coming off of a mood stabilizer? my psychiatrist said there would be no withdrawal... but i am definitely more unstable than i was, or so it seems. will this go away?

Seroquel - drowsiness,"Hey folks, 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has had any success with combating drowsiness caused by seroquel. I took abilify previously but got crazy neck spasms (torticollis / tardive dyskinesia) from it and had to switch. 

Problem is that I am so drowsy now from the seroquel that it‚Äôs affecting my life. I am a masters student with a full time job and 3 kids. I‚Äôm usually a pretty motivated go getter kind of person but I can‚Äôt get out of bed with this seroquel. It‚Äôs making me fall short in basically every aspect of life. 

I take 100mg before bed and the only thing that gets me out of bed is knowing I am going to be late for work. On weekends I can easily sleep for 12 hours and again the only thing that gets me up is that my kids are up. I usually shake off the drowsiness after an hour or so of moving around.

I‚Äôm losing it‚Ä¶,"TW: mentions of SH and suicide.


I 31F have struggled with mental illness my entire life. As an adult I have fought and fought to get help and stay strong. It‚Äôs been an exhausting life tbh. I just keep getting shit thrown at me, it hasn‚Äôt ever stopped. I have a significant amount of trauma from my life and I finally found a place that I got actually progressive help. I felt so trapped in my trauma for so long and I found a place to help! I was receiving trauma informed cared through therapy and getting my treatment resistant depression treated with spravato along with other meds. I had been going to this place for spravato treatments for 2.5 years and trauma informed therapy for 7 months, until recently. 


So rewind back to December, I find out my therapist is moving a a veteran‚Äôs hospital. So I lose her, but good news she found a replacement! Well turns out this replacement didn‚Äôt work out and no other replacement was found. Fast forward a couple weeks and I find out the entire center is closing. I‚Äôm losing my med management, my spravato treatments and essentially my family I found in this community. I‚Äôve been falling apart ever since.


 I just started my masters program after being out of school for 5 years. I‚Äôm fucking loosing it guys. Melt down, full blown crying panicking melt downs everyday for the last 3 days straight, before that every couple of days. I feel so out of control and abandoned. I have almost met my deductible and once I do I have a therapist lined up to start seeing. And I have found another place to get my med management and treatments done at, but it‚Äôs not the same. It‚Äôs not my family that I built. It‚Äôs not it. I‚Äôm so heart broken. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt get it, no matter how many times I try to explain it or beg for help in the way I need it. I‚Äôve told him my love language is words of affirmations and I‚Äôve even told him exactly what things he could say to help me feel better and he just doesn‚Äôt do it. I have family that is supportive, but I have a history of suicide attempts and I fear they will think I‚Äôm going to be at risk for that again. I know I‚Äôm safe, I won‚Äôt do that but I understand their fear. I try to keep it together in front of them. 


I‚Äôve had urges to go back to my self harming habits because I know they will calm me down, momentarily but I don‚Äôt do it. I just feel like I‚Äôm literally going insane and I‚Äôm all alone in it. I‚Äôve told my boyfriend this too, and there‚Äôs so solution there. Idk what to do. Idk how to keep it together because I‚Äôm really scared what‚Äôs going to happen if I keep going down this road.

Going to the Spravato clinic is fine when Im in a don't leave the house mood because I have a private room at the clinic. That nearly 2 hours of sleep and the Ensure are drank helped a lot. Certain strange feelings from this morning are better with that nap. If my insomnia hit day 3 psychosis sets in to some degree. Sleep can be the best medicine sometimes. But there's the thing. I reach a day every catches up and I crash into a deep long dreamless sleep and feel really good. Even my appetite returns. But it never lasts. My brain gets haywire and the cycle repeats. If I don't watch it I'm going to be sitting in the hospital and I won't be there on my own free will, My mental health is having a bad effect on my physical health. Psychologically I've even grown to dislike eating and sleeping but I know they have to be done or you die. Who's running this show because it's not me? I see my psychiatrist tomorrow. I like him. He's very highly respected and knowledgeable. But I can't properly communicate with him through a TV screen. But I'm very lucky to have him. I've got to work on some way to enhance communication. He's not even in my state. He's owns the group which is in a few states. Thankfully my therapist is in person. I know virtual is a pro at times and is better for some people but I need an in person bond.",558
I am just so tired,"I am not sure how you can support me. I have had anxiety my whole life but in 2021 I started having regular severe panic attacks that ended in the ER twice. I stopped eating so I admitted to inpatient treatment for an eating disorder and was in various levels of treatment for 6 months. With meds I stopped having panic attacks and started eating but anxiety was still really bad. I did another outpatient program for anxiety. I tried to function for like 6 months but couldn‚Äôt manage and moved closer to my family who is my support system. I got a job but felt so incredibly overwhelmed that I froze at my desk every day. I reached a point of SI and spent the night in a crisis center. I quit my job, got out of my lease and moved in with my parents. Ive tried 7-8 medications over the last two years, am on 4 different ones right now. I tried Spravato for several months and have not seen results. My anxiety turned to deep deep depression and I am now barely functioning. I shower maybe once a week. I have zero energy and motivation, and I am a shadow of my former self. I struggle to speak very much. I did an assessment for TMS last week and am waiting to be scheduled to start that. I feel at this point, like I am the exception to every treatment and cannot imagine ever getting out of this. Is there anything about my story that stands out to you? Anything I should try, that I haven‚Äôt yet? I have been in this depression for 6 months now and I don‚Äôt recognize myself anymore. ",559
Treatment-Resistant Depression,"Does anyone else have treatment resistant depression, and if so, how do you manage it? I've tried 10 different medications and am about to start a new one. I have severe depression that impacts my everyday functioning and have had it for about 9 years now (wavering in severity over the years, of course). I try everything. I've tried ashwagandha, I exercise a couple times a week most weeks, drink water, eat healthy most of the time, get sunlight... and yet nothing works. My psych just put me on a new med, an antipsychotic. It makes me feel crazy. And I dont feel great going through the side effects and waiting period of new medications. It discourages me so much... how does anyone else do it?",560
At a loss for what medication to try next to get me out this slump..help please,"I‚Äôve been on a number of medications including;

Fluoxetine 
Escitalopram 
Paroxetine 
Sertraline 
Venlafaxine 
Duloxetine & Lamotrigine 
Bupropion & Fluoxetine 
Vortioxetine 
Clomipramine 
Moclobemide & Aripiprazole 

I‚Äôm currently on Duloxetine & Lamotrigine, and my sleep pattern is f*cked (worst it‚Äôs ever been), I‚Äôve shut myself off from social interactions, no desire to do anything - nor energy to do so. 

I‚Äôm really at a loss as I need to get out of this slump and change immediately, and what I‚Äôm currently taking is contributing to this I believe. But having tried a number of medications, I don‚Äôt know what to try next as SSRIs I‚Äôm done with, SNRIs I‚Äôm done with, have only tried one Tricyclic, Irreversible MAOIs are incredibly difficult to get on the NHS in the UK - but I would try them if they could help, just don‚Äôt know how easy it would be to get a prescription. 

I feel like I‚Äôm only left with Reboxetine, Selegiline, Agomelatine, and Tricyclics. 

What would you suggest?",561
Revolutionary therapy,"Hi all,

This is a very serious topic to me and I have researched it extensively for over a year now. Because this is serious to me this post will be quite long. The read is appreciated along with any responses, because when I talk about this in real life I end up in the psych ward. 

I believe in myself, and my European friends believe in me, so all you Americans who keep putting me in the psych ward can keep it to your self. I don‚Äôt need to hear the logistical impossibilities of why our world is so broken.  

To shed some light on my own understanding of mental health and psychiatry; I received a traumatic brain injury at 17 and was promptly diagnosed with Bi-Polar 1 with psychotic effects, after a manic episode landing me in the psych ward for the first time. 

I‚Äôve been to the psych ward 3 times in America and 1 time in Denmark (for 4 weeks. It was very effective there. They treated me very well and I haven‚Äôt gone back since for over a year). 

I‚Äôve been on Lithium, Risperdone, Wellbutrin, and I‚Äôm currently taking Lamictal, Abilify, and adderall. Great combo for me especially after my ketamine treatment over 2 years ago which really cured the depressive symptoms of my Bi-polar. So fortunately, I only face manic symptoms off my meds. 

Last year in June I was taking a night time drive after work, and this phrase popped into my head. It was like god STRUCK me with detailed knowledge and understanding of a topic nowhere on the internet. I was on my meds and eating well and working out at the time so it did make sense for this manic shit to happen. 

I began writing about it and telling my friends, they told me not to tell anyone and to go back to school for this. 

I was 19 at the time and living with my parents. My mothers always had alcohol issues and kicked me out one night that June because we had a disagreement about her drinking. 

I got a room at a local motel in my city and couldn‚Äôt do much since my car was broken down and my job was Instacart. At the motel I met a man named Duane Lavold, look him up, one hit wonder from 2002. I lived in Quebec till I was 7 and Duane was from Toronto so we began a conversation in French after I asked him for a cigarette. 

A few hours later I divulged the details of my hypothesis and the state of my family life at home. He didn‚Äôt have much to say. He thought for a moment and he said; look, you need to goto Paris. Forget your old life here and go test you ‚Äútheory‚Äù in Europe. I had about 12k left over from my lawsuit from the traumatic brain injury. So I did. I bought a one way ticket to Paris with no intent on returning to California. 

I stayed in a hostel in Paris for 2 month and used my hypothesis on my hostel mates, the staff, and random Parisian‚Äôs. And it is so vivid and apparent this ‚Äúthing‚Äù to me that I had to admit myself to the psych ward in Denmark. 

I‚Äôm not going to write out the term I want to coin on Reddit as someone will probably steal it; but the hypothesis is a mixture of Freudian ideology complimented by Jungian therapeutics. 

While the actual ‚Äúrevolutionary therapy‚Äù deals with an                     empathogen, like MDA or MDMA but not intense as another semi-psychedelic like 2C-B, and spravato ketamine; either nasal spray or IV drip. 

And all this stuff has been rattling around in my head since I took pure MDMA at the age of 16, I‚Äôm 21 now. 

When I start focusing on this stuff it makes me manic but when I put it to the side it makes me sad because; I know how much ketamine treatment helped me‚Ä¶ so if there was an MDMA + ketamine TALK THERAPY imagine the lives that could be changed! :(

I don‚Äôt think anyone can really help me with this just frustrating I don‚Äôt have a PHD and FDA funding.",562
Should I try Ketamine or ECT therapy?,"I suffer from severe depression and Rumination is a major factor in it. I also have ADHD, Autism and OCD.  I feel like I need a drastic option like these two therapies in order to be happy again. I suffered Akathesia in February from Abilify and I haven't been the same person since. I have extremely bad Rumination, where a memory replays in my head over and over again. I need to stop this somehow, it's killing me.",563
Ketamine Therapy,"Hi all, I‚Äôm looking for insight into anyone‚Äôs experience with Ketamine therapy for depression. I just did my first dose of Ketamine nasal spray last night. It‚Äôs a little confusing, but the bottle says ‚Äúketamine 100mgs/ml (10mg/spray)‚Äù so maybe that means there‚Äôs 10 mg‚Äôs per spray. The first spritz I did I really didn‚Äôt feel much. Just kinda drowsy. So I did another spritz in each nostril 45 mins later (my psych said I could do one or two spritzes) and that‚Äôs when I felt a little nauseous and a little drowsier. But nothing drastic. I‚Äôm not sure what I expected from it, maybe I expected to trip out or be loopier, haha, but neither happened. I still needed to take sleeping meds because altho it induced drowsiness, it didn‚Äôt put me to sleep in any way. Today I feel kinda like nothing at all? I feel anxious like usual, but in terms of other emotions, I don‚Äôt feel anything very strongly. Again, I kinda feel like nothing. Which, tbh, is not necessarily a bad thing. My regular days consist of sobbing and telling myself horrible things about myself and struggling to see the point in living. So, Idn. I‚Äôm just looking to see what other people have experienced with this type of therapy. Thank you in advance for your answers.",564
Does anyone else take Spravato (Ketamine) for depression?,It works really well for me! It‚Äôs a fairly new treatment for depression. I got prescribed on it back in 2021.

10 weeks post bad trip/bad reaction to illicit ketamine and my SNRI.. severe depression anxiety tremors. ,"Hey I am really struggling. I used to be a happy motivated, goal orientated bubbly kind caring person but since I had a bad reaction khole that was super traumatic to illicit drugs I have lost my mind, I find it hard to concentrate, enjoy life, think clearly, I am always feeling uncomfortable. I've never experienced this before its basically 24 7 and I'd thought I'd be better by now.. I've been seeing psychologist psychiatrist, natural healing but nothing helps, unfortunately taking valiums now just to provide the slightest bit of ease. I just want to be better again. Meditation deep breathing don't change much.. it was so bad at the start I had vertigo dizziness memory loss. I want my life back.. I've been to my gps but they have no idea how to help. 
I don't know either I just keep losing weight.. I also went to hospital at the early stages and they told me to go to my GP.. 

I feel sp alone because I don't know anyone that's gone through this.. nobody knows. 

Not a regular ketamine user either..",566

Is it OK to take 5-HTP and DLPA every day?,"Going through old threads I saw someone say serotonin and dopamine are on a see-saw: one goes up as one goes down. So maybe these need to be taken at alternate times or days?

Also, someone else said ""*5-htp is not Tryptophan and you shouldnt take it. just take Tryptophan, not 5-htp.*"" The post was too old to ask them to explain.

These two things made me wonder if I should be taking them everyday and whether I should replace 5-HTP with Tryptophan - I saw someone else say they switched to Tryptophan but they had worse effects from it.

I have also been following Dr Huberman, who takes Phenylethylamine (PEA), just once a week or two, whereas my DLPA is DL-Phenylalanine. I researched this recently and it seemed like more people recommended the latter, but Dr Huberman knows a lot more than me and my quick Googling. Some other people take L-Phenylalanine, but I saw several posts saying DL is more effective.

I have been taking a 500mg DLPA with one or two 200mg 5-HTP. I generally take as needed and only started with DLPA recently. I have used 5-HTP for years as a quick mood enhancer with one 200mg pill maybe once or twice a week. Any advice from your experiences would be much appreciated.",568
Nightmare Disorder Advice & Treatment Experiences?,"I haven't had restful sleep in 7 years due to incredibly vivid & intense dreams/nightmares that occur every night, multiple times a night (assumed to be a lasting side effect of a trial of Cipralex). I wake up more exhausted each morning; it‚Äôs as if a part of me hasn‚Äôt shut off‚Ä¶like it‚Äôs being forced to watch high anxiety/morbid scenes each night without getting rest/turning off. I don‚Äôt have recurring dreams (although the themes are constant...suffocation/drowning/anxiety/panic/shame > classic nightmares) or any ‚Äòbig T‚Äô traumas but suffer from quiet borderline personality disorder, depression & OCPD.

I've tried keeping a good sleep hygiene routine, melatonin, tryptophan, magnesium, CBD/CBN, dream water, sleeping pills, prazosin, triazolam etc. with no positive change. THC (semi-helpful) has heavily caused dissociation/brain fog, lack of clarity/focus & extreme lethargy.

The consistent lack of restful sleep is destroying me‚Ä¶any advice/relatable experiences would be SOO APPRECIATED.

How can I escape from anxiety?,"Hi, from the start I apologize for my English, it's not my first language. I am in college and I feel really overwhelmed lately. I constantly feel the tension in my body, I can't sleep well and when I wake up my heart starts pumping right away because I have to do so many things. I have so much to do for school, but I just can't. I feel exhausted even though I don't do anything. I just worry all the time and I don't know how to stop. I started to take some medicine with tryptophan which should help me with this anxiety, but nothing has changed so far. Is there something else I can do? Some kind of exercise or medicine? I want to visit a therapist, but I don't have time or money right now.",570
Strange MDMA experience,"Hi, I would like to know what do you think of my first experience with ecstasy, and If something like this ever happened to someone.

First, I'm a 24 male. I always thought there was something wrong in my way of thinking. I always was shy and avoiding social interactions. I have (I think) social anxiety and sleep problems. I was doing anxiety when taking cannabis with people, whereas it was psychedelic when I was alone. Also, coffee just gave me anxiety.

One year ago, I was drunk and I took 2 ecstasys with friends (I don‚Äôt know the dose exactly). At the end of the trip, I took ‚ÄúAfter D‚Äù pills from Zamnesia, it contained :

*Capsule: l-tryptophan, pyridoxine HCl, anticoagulant agent (vegetarian magnesium stearate), anti-caking agent (silica), intake (cellulose), 00-vegacapsule.*

*Tablet 1: ascorbic acid (dc), anti-caking agent (silica), anticoagulant (vegetarian magnesium stearate), citrus aurantium (60% hesperidin), rosehip (rosehip) 20: 1, intake (cellulose).*

*Tablet 2: calcium carbonate, chromium picolinate, manganese citrate, copper citrate, iron fumarate, zinc citrate, magnesium oxide, selenium yeast 2000 ppm, riboflavin, potassium chloride.*

The ecstasy didn‚Äôt really affected me wildly during the night, I was just enjoying the moment with my friends, and I wanted to talk to them, but I felt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

But the effects where more interesting after : I was expecting a down and to be depressed after that day. I was recovering physically for few days, but my mood kept increase abnormally for several days. Then, for two or three MONTHS I felt like a better version of myself. All my social anxiety was gone. I was more talkative, and I wanted to see my friends and family more. I noticed that I had brain fog all this time because now my thinking was clear and sharp : I could really think about something for a long time, and not just think about it from far away. I found pleasure in thinking and everything was enjoyable and interesting because it was making sense. I had also a tremendous memory. In fact, I was just feeling ‚Äúawake‚Äù. It was like magic, I thought I was finally ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I was the version of myself I always struggled to be, it was an ‚Äúepiphany‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt know what make me feel like this : mdma or anything else in this pill, or the supplement I took the evening. But somehow it confirmed to me that something is unbalanced in my brain, and I could just think normally if I fix it. This is why I became interested in nootropics.

Of course, what I feared the most happened : this effect didn‚Äôt last and now I have slowly returned to normal : I have trouble to think ‚Äúnormally‚Äù : I jump one thought to another, I can‚Äôt remember simple things, and I can‚Äôt find sense about thinking to something for few minutes because I find it boring. On the other and, I can become very obsessive about personal projects. Then, I can not think of anything else during several days, and I need to work on it until it‚Äôs finished or until I'm completely exhausted.

**I think there is a problem in the chemical balance of my brain**. I don't know what is it, but this experience somehow revealed that i could think better and that i am in a fog brain all day long.

Citalopram,"Hey I‚Äôve been on citalopram for like 2 months now - before I started taking it I really struggled with falling asleep but now I literally sleep every night for 15 hours - I find it impossible to wake myself up at the right time and I‚Äôm tired even after I wake up

Citalopram vs ecitalopram,"After finding citalopram quite helpful in the past I asked for it again. 
The doctor misheard and gave me ecitalopram at 20mg. 

It‚Äôs only been over a week. When starting citalopram I always noticed a dry mouth, I didn‚Äôt with this but experienced mild dizziness on and off that seems to have subsided now. 

Felt the few days of feeling in a weird dream-like state, which seems to be the same as citalopram. 

I‚Äôm hoping it works as well for anxiety for me as citalopram does as well as depression.

Citalopram Withdrawal,"Hey guys, just a quick question. I am about to change my meds so I am having to stop my citalopram. My doctor said that discontinuation shouldn't be to bad so I shouldn't need to do a full taper... I went from every day to every other day to nothing.

Anyway, I've noticed myself getting increasingly agitated over small shit while also making a lot of small mistakes that I shouldn't be making. I feel like my mind is a bit cloudy but I'm also getting pissed at myself at the drop of a hat. Is this a normal reaction? Or am I just having a bad few days(entirely possible)?

Sorry if this is getting into medical advice, it is more of a past experience question.",574
How hard is it to stop Citalopram? (10mg),"I ask because I've been on it nearly 4 weeks and haven't noticed a single difference other than side effects.

I've felt nauseous as well as a dry mouth/throat and I had some sexual side effects, the latter seems to have gone away for the most part.

I've not noticed any benefits from them and I know they can take around 4 weeks to start working but I saw a lot of people say that they noticed at least small differences after the first couple of weeks, I've noticed nothing.

I have about 1 week left of my packet and I'm considering taking half a pill a day or even 1 pill every 2 days as I read going cold turkey can be a bad idea but I just don't feel like they're worth taking at this point.

I went in about my inability to sleep and I came out with anti-depressants. My depression resides in being very apathetic, I do not have suicidal tendencies nor do I or would I ever self-harm, so for me, I feel as though its not serious enough for medication? Maybe that's narrow minded of me and this could help prevent anything from worsening in the future.

From the age of, I'd say, 15 I've felt this way and it hasn't gotten worse, just stayed the same. I'm very apathetic. I lack emotion but I also lack the ability to understand emotions and social ques. The only noticeable thing about me that does worry me is my tendency to overthink and worry, in that sense I am very anxious.

It has caused issues in my relationship, not from her pov (I've talked to her about it and she isn't worried) but from my pov, I've suffered from what I think is ""ROCD"" because I can feel extreme guilt, overthink and worry about all the typical things people with ROCD worry about. I've had awful times where I couldn't function because I was panicking that I might not truly love her or that what if she ""isn't the one"" until I learned about ""the myth of the one"" from a book about ROCD written by Sheva Rajaee, MFT. I've since come to learn that love is more of a choice than a feeling, that the honey moon phase ending is inevitable and that afterwards, love is choosing to be with that person which has helped me overcome ROCD for the most part but it does still lurk in the background.",575
Going from Sertraline to Citalopram...,"So, just over a week ago I was put on 50mg Sertraline (Zoloft) after deciding to take control of my depression after years of just ignoring it. Anyway a serious relationship ended and it hit me bad, made my depression worse to the point where I was suicidal. I was put on the meds and instantly noticed a massive difference. All my negative thoughts went and I feel so much better too. My doctor says that's unlikely as it can take weeks for it to kick in, is this true? Is what I'm feeling a placebo effect?  


Also, Sertraline gave me really bad restless legs on a night to the point where I've been getting no more than 2 hours sleep a night, so she switched me to 10mg Citalopram...What should I expect from switching? Will it take another 4-6 weeks to kick in? I was only on Sertraline for a week.  


Thanks!",576
Citalopram and depression???,"I am posting this on every subreddit related to this issue so sorry if you have already seen.

This is a really long post so I understand if you don't have time/ want to read it, but anybody that does, I am really scared and could use some opinions or advice. I also know that the grammar in this post is awful but as I am rambling and scared, I don't really care, so sorry if this horrible sentence structure is hard to read.

&#x200B;

Hi, ive never posted on reddit but I need advice. As a background I am a 21 year old male, and I am a bit of an anxious person and a hypochondriac , but that is all. I have never been depressed or suicidal at all, and that is why I am making this post. Back in February of 2023, I took a math test and aced it. Later that same night, I came down with flu like symptoms, like shivers, nausea, and fatigue and weakness. After a horrible night of these symptoms, it passed by the next morning and I thought nothing else of it. Later in March of 2023, I took another math test and had what I presume to be my first panic attack. I wasn't scared for the test at all but I suddenly became nauseous in the room and felt dizzy and abdominal discomfort. I felt those same flu like symptoms return once more and they crippled me for a day, and that is when I started having multiple panic attacks.My anxiety was so through the roof that I swore that if this wasn't gone in a month, I wouldn't want to live. It was indescribably awful and every moment was filled with fear coming from literally nowhere. I literally had to basically be babysat by my parents as I never wanted to be alone because I was so scared, and if you know me, I am someone who loves and prefers being alone. I am a definitive introvert. 

&#x200B;

During this time I cried so much when I usually don't cry that often, and I truly thought this was going to be my life. I was prescribed Citalopram on March 16th, and my anxiety slowly back to normal over 2 months, and my doctor upped my dose to 20mg. I still did have health anxiety like a toe twitch that appeared in late March, and I started to think I could have ALS. It's hard being a hypochondriac, but I got over thinking I had ALS. I don't know if it was the citalopram or me just getting over that episode myself, but I continued taking it and started seeing a therapist for anxiety issues. I have always been socially awkward and unwelcoming to trying new things, but I wanted to change that! Over the next 6 months, I was happy, content, and I began to socialize and get out more.I was peaceful and content with life just like I was before the episode started, but I still had no idea what went wrong with me during the episode to make me freak out and be in awful mental pain for 2-3 weeks. I have wanted to join a club, and so on September 29th of 2023, I went to go see if I would like it, hoping that it was just a tight knit group of people that I could befriend, and it turned out there were like 50 people and I got discouraged, and thus I was still too socially scared to join the people in the club with their activities. I was a bit disappointed in myself but I went back to the club page on the website and I began searching for others clubs, because I wasn't giving up. However, after going about my evening happy and content and masturbating once, (I don't know why I included this, I just want to tell all the details hoping someone will know whats wrong) at around 10PM the anxiety flooded back. All that horrible anxiety for no reason flooded my mind in a second, and the interests in all of my hobbies decreased to zero in a matter of minutes.I was prepared this time, as I said to myself, ""alright, we know what this is and we know that it will pass, so just try to be calm and try to enjoy yourself even if you can't."" 

&#x200B;

I was mentally ready to let this anxiety pass, and in a few days, pass it did. The problem was that the anxiety was gone, but my interests in all my hobbies was not. I thought that would pass as well, but I waited for a few days, and then I began to feel sad. Throughout the next week, I started having thoughts about wanting to die because I had not felt a bit of joy since September 29th. I had an appointment with my doctor and she prescribed Wellbutrin, but I didn't take it at first. This continued for every moment of every day until October 10th, 2023, where I had a bad night of crying and was admitted to the ER for suicidal thoughts. I truly didn't trust myself to not go through with it, even though I know I would never be able to actually do it. I was admitted for the night to a mental hospital, and in the morning they upped my dose of Citalopram to 30mg and I started the 150mg Wellbutrin XL.It has been about 4 weeks since the 10th as I am writing this, but nothing has gotten better. I still cry, and existence is unbearably painful currently. My mood ranges from totally awful to unbearable, and I still have not experienced joy since September 29th. I am so scared and its so hard to keep on fighting, and I will, but I need answers. I have been so concerned with finding the answer to this medical mystery. I have started to have sleep starts (also called hypnic jerks) and so sleep is hard when it never has been before. I have to take Gabapentin now at 300mg to sleep at all without getting woken up from sleep starts, and I wake up hours earlier than I usually should and I simply cannot get back to sleep, even if I try my hardest. The mental hospital diagnosed me with Major Depressive disorder, but I have only ever been depressed during this episode of whatever I have. The first episode was anxiety, and now this one is depression. I don't understand what is happening, and the only constant is that I took finasteride for hair loss when both episodes took place. 

&#x200B;

I took finasteride at 0.5mg for 9 months before March 9th, and then I quit cold turkey when I started having the anxiety. I started finasteride at 1mg again in early July because I assumed it couldn't have to do with my anxiety episode, so I took it for 3 months until October 4th, when I threw it out. I have searched online and found something called Post finasteride syndrome that isn't medically recognized, but some people have similar symptoms on the drug. As it isn't medically recognized, I don't know if I should believe I have PFS, because it currently has no cure.Back to the main point though, could me taking Citalopram for 6 months with minimal side effects have resulted in this depressive episode. Is it possible that while Citalopram worked for these 6 months, it has now decided to give me side effects of depression later in treatment? If I stop Citalopram, could I go back to normal, or will my anxiety from March come back instead??? Like I said, I have never been suicidal or depressed and so feeling these two things together so suddenly is strange, so I keep thinking that it may be an outside source, like the finasteride or Citalopram, that is making me feel this way. If anybody has any knowledge or even just opinions, I need help badly ):. I know depression can come on at any age, and starts in many people around my age, but I don't know. I don't lay in bed all day with my depression, I still keep my routine even though it gives me no joy and I feel horrible mental pain inside. I run every other day for 3.3 miles still, I still go to college 2 days a week, and I want this to get better. I am so sick of feeling this way, and its like a light switch turned off September 29th that hasn't come back on yet. 

&#x200B;

I have had self mild self esteem issues for my teenage years and till now but through therapy I love myself more than ever, and I don't feel guilty or feel like I don't deserve help. I have a wonderful family who I tell all this to, because when I am feeling bad, I am not able to keep it inside, I must talk about it with others, usually my parents or a doctor, almost like I am asking for help.Like I said, I dream about being how I was before September 29th again, and I have been waiting for something to happen, but I am still miserable to this day since then. I don't know what to do and it's almost like my will to live was swiped from me, as all I feel is pain. I have always been so afraid of death, so the fact that dying doesn't even sound the worst is so frightening to me right now, and I need help!!! I also have OCD but i don't really have many compulsions, so I don't believe OCD is causing this. I have always had it and I don't think it is the problem, but that is the reason my Citalopram was upped to 30mg, to cancel out the OCD thoughts.I am miserable in part because I can't think of anything else when I want to die and when nothing feels enjoyable, but I feel like anybody would not be able to think of anything else if they thought the same suddenly. I am so sorry that this is so long, but I am so scared I will not get better and that I may have to try multiple more antidepressants, which I hear can be awful to get off and the fact that they can have horrible side effects. 

&#x200B;

Does anybody have any opinion, was it the Citalopram to make me feel depressed suddenly after 6 months of taking it, could it be the finasteride, could I just have depression I developed genetically, or is there something else causing it?Before this year I had never had an anxiety/panic attack and had never been depressed, so what gives? Should I get off the Citalopram by tapering to see if my Depression goes away, or should I wait a few more weeks to see if the 30mg kicks in for the OCD one of the staff at the mental health facility thought. I've been on 30 mg now for 4 weeks, and same with Wellbutrin, but I still feel excruciatingly horrible. Should I wait for 8 weeks for my Citalopram and Wellbutrin, should I just get off of them, or what? I have been referred to a psychiatrist but they are booked and will call when they are available for new patients, so that could be literally any time from now till the end of time. I am losing hope that it will get better, and two weeks again my therapist said to think positive thoughts and force the negatives out, and that's what I did. It actually did make the depression a microscopic bit better, (and i mean literally almost nothing microscopic) but I had hope that this would get better.

&#x200B;

 I am losing hope again and I need opinions and ideas.For the past 4 or 5 days I have actually been feeling worse than I did before, and I don't even know how that's possible. Since it's been 4 weeks since upping Citalopram to 30mg and starting Wellbutrin, could they be making me even worse these past few days or am I just giving up and that's why I am doing worse? I just feel like something is physically wrong with me, whether it be a brain tumor or a drug causing my depression, like Citalopram or finasteride. I never felt this way and I know what I am supposed to feel, so there must be something wrong, I can feel it. Maybe I just have clinical depression and decided to make its first debut September 29th, but then what was the anxiety episode a few months ago? Why was it anxiety the first time and depression now? This episode started with anxiety, but it went away and turned into depression through the weeks following.

&#x200B;

I am going to go get my hormones checked so if anybody has any ideas which ones I should have checked, that would be great. I plan on getting my testosterone checked, maybe my vitamin D, my cortisol possibly, do a stool test, and whatever else I need like maybe get my Zinc checked. I don't know if you can check serotonin levels but if you can maybe I should try that. I spend too much time googling symptoms due to my hypochondria, so I have been googling every possible cause for my depression.I know i've said all this but when I panic I ramble on and on, and I am obviously doing that in text form currently. Please help me I beg you, i've even started reading the Bible and praying to God every night to try and end this nightmarish feeling. I want to live the rest of my life, I want to be happy again, I want to be motivated again, I want to play video games with my friends again, I want to meet new friends again, but right now I don't want any of that, because I am so concerned that I will always be miserable. If you actually read all this, thank you so much and please help, I want to live, I want to find out how to get out of this hole, and I want to never have it happen again.",577
Citalopram,"So I thought I‚Äôd share my journey on citalopram as honest as I can be, I know it sucks when you first go onto AD and researching and researching every single side effect out there but trust me I did exactly the same, I cried my eyes out I was so anxious to take the medication I put it off a day I was prescribed it because I had been on it before and it increased my panic attacks and anxious thoughts. So here we go: 

Day 1: I took 10mg at 13:40pm I instantly got anxiety the moment I swallowed it. No it wasn‚Äôt a side effect it was my stupid brain convincing me something bad was about to happen. Which it didn‚Äôt. It got to 14:44pm and I thought to myself right it‚Äôs been an hour now the side effects will come on soon. All I had was thirst and a bout of diarrhoea. It is now 15:45pm and I‚Äôve started to get slight heaviness come over my head, another bout of diarrhoea and extreme thirst. Will continue to update as the day goes on.",578
Increasing Citalopram dosage,"I have been taking the minimun dose of Citalopram (10 mg)  daily since November 2021 and from the beginning I felt a sensation of relief for my anxiety and depression. Since then, I never felt the need to increase my dosage but since almost two months  my anxiety is growing back. There is a part of it I can resolve by myself through what I've learnt in therapy (I did therapy for almost 15 years until I was discharged from it last May), but there is an overall feeling that I can't resolve, but I can summarize as a fear of being trapped in my own mind, not being able to concentrate, negative intrusive thoughts and a sensation of impending doom. I am about to turn 37 and even though my life is ok, there are many things I would like still to achieve, but in order to reach that, I need the energy and peace that I've been feeling from the medication. If I sit down and think through it, I can reach a feeling of calm, but I honestly feel like a switch was turned off and a part of me is not functioning anymore.   


I have an appointment with my psychiatrist next week and I will tell him this, but I can't help to feel I am a failure for not being able to solve this by my own after so many years of therapy... which makes me feel worse. Also, I am afraid of the secondary effects and the thought of coming back to therapy

I would be happy to read your experience and thoughts on increasing the dosage.

Have Citalopram lost its effect? Switch to different SSRI?,"ER doc and new father since 7 months here. Been on Citalopram 40mg for a long time. Initially got it after consequences of several concussions/mild traumatic brain injury 15 years ago. Eventually went off it and later had a burnout with much insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, brain fog, lack of energy and likely depression. 

Went back on Citalopram, then switched to Mirtazapin. Felt absolutely awful until we added back Citalopram in combination. Reduced my depression score by half over just a few weeks and then slowly improved from the burnout(but suffered side effects so went off Mirtazapin after a year and continued Citalopram). 

After a few years of getting back to normal and now 3 years work as a ER physician I have since 1 year had similar symptoms and been on and off work/sick leave. Me and my psychiatrist chose not to change/add medication but since my rehabilitation is stagnant I feel something needs to happen. Difficult situation with a small child also. 

Currently unsure whether Citalopram has lost effect or if its just not enough. Have noted that side effects such as difficulty reaching orgasm is not as prominent as from what I remember previously. Could this be an indication that it has lost effect and that maybe a different SSRI may be sufficient? Otherwise I will have to restart Mirtazapin combination. 

Thank you for your insights and experiences. ",580
Switching from Citalopram to Sertraline,"I‚Äôve been on citalopram for the past year or so, and I‚Äôve been noticing that it‚Äôs making me feel like I‚Äôm in a bit of a bubble. 

It‚Äôs helped with not feeling constantly overwhelmed and not having any emotional energy apart from what I need to survive, but I don‚Äôt really ‚Äúfeel‚Äù things. I‚Äôm a bit disconnected from the world and the people around me.

Has anyone else experienced this?

I‚Äôm thinking of asking to switch to Sertraline to see whether that helps. I‚Äôd be interested in hearing other people‚Äôs perspectives on this.",581
Tapering Off Celexa (citalopram),"Hey guys!

I have a psychiatrist appointment tomorrow where I'm pretty sure I'll be switching from my current antidepressant (Celexa, 40mg) to a new one.

I'm really nervous - EXTREMELY nervous - about this. 

I was previously taking Lexapro (30mg) and was switched to Celexa after bad reactions to the Lexapro. During this switch, I didn't have to taper or come off of anything because the two medications are in the same family. 

Now, however, I'll likely go onto Pristiq or similar, meaning I'll have to completely come off of Celexa for at least a short while. 

Since starting antidepressants five years ago, I have never come off of them completely. There was one time due to a psychiatrist being a terrible psychiatrist that I ended up rationing my dose for a week, and even then the side effects were awful. 

Guys, I'm already not in a good place (hence switching the meds). I'm so scared of what might happen when I'm completely off my antidepressants. I'm a full time college student and although I'm currently unemployed due to an unrelated minor surgery I intend on working part time to make ends meet.

Edit because I forgot to finish my thought here: I say the whole ""working and studying"" thing because it means I don't really have the time nor the money to like... be institutionalized. I'm also scared of being committed because my brother had a really terrible experience with a mental hospital.

I know my psychiatrist will help me, but I'm just so scared. 

What do I do here? Looking for support and prior experiences. Thanks in advance.",582
Citalopram working early?,"So I started having 1 tablet of 20mg citalopram in a morning as of Tuesday this week. My doctor told me that I wouldn‚Äôt notice any difference for at least 1-2 weeks and would only get the full benefit after 6 weeks.

But after my third dose today I already feel different is this normal? I struggle with depression and anxiety mostly anxiety around social situations and the future.

Before If i thought about my future it would always loop in my mind to the result of ‚Äòit won‚Äôt get better so its easier if I kill myself‚Äô and i couldn‚Äôt get out of this loop for 5 years. So I‚Äôve been on auto pilot since my routine was. 
sleep for as long as possible - work - grab food on the way home - sleep till its time to work again. For 5 years it‚Äôs been like this and even after the first day of meds I felt more awake. 

Socially, I couldn‚Äôt talk to people at all I‚Äôd stutter and stumble over my words, sweat, feel a pit in my stomach like I‚Äôd be about to throw up and I could never maintain eye contact. This applies to everyone even colleagues I‚Äôve known for years. But today I just had a meeting with my boss which would usually trigger all these symptoms and I had none‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to explain it but it feels like I‚Äôm empty but not in a bad way just like I don‚Äôt feel anything.

Citalopram Side Effects,"Hi everyone,

After many months putting it off, I finally started taking Citalopram for my depression (about 4 hours ago).

Just wondering if anybody else experienced the same thing so quickly and has any tips, because it‚Äôs making me want to stop taking further pills.

Citalopram Generic Switch - Help,"Not sure if this is the right place to post, but I have been taking generic citalopram (Celexa) from Torrent pharmaceuticals (40mg pink ovals) for about 3 years now and doing fine. Last week I received my prescription and the pills were white and circular from the company Mylan. Didn't think much of it at the time, but a week later all my initial SSRI startup symptoms, plus the overwhelming anxiety, have all returned in full force. I am in complete and utter despair currently, suffering from extreme derealization. I have a fulltime job and kid to take care of, I can't have this happening. Already called the pharmacy and they told me their contract with Torrent ran up and I'm SOL.   
Any suggestions as to where to go from here are appreciated.. All I can think of is calling other pharmacies to see which generic they carry, maybe have my doctor write a new prescription.. Or should I just suck it up and get used to the new generic, even though they could just pull the same crap again next time..?",585
Celexa (citalopram) + Trazodone,"I have been taking this combo for  20 yrs. I take Celexa 20 mg around lunch time and Trazodone 50 mg before bed. When I started taking the combo, at 29 it was my first exposure to a psychoactive substance (never did any legal or illegal drugs or psychoactive substances before that) . Celexa helped to feel good ( first few weeks were like a Xmas morning everyday) and helped me gain confidence at work. 20 yrs later I am self-sufficient financially and modestly successful, probably due to the two drugs. 

But now they don't do much. After I lost my support system during COVID, and as some family members passed away, the dark clouds have gathered overhead again. I see no future or have any hope left. But I still need to function to survive and pay my bills. I have been planning to end my life after Mom passes away, but not sure I will go through with it unless I can find a surefire painless way to do it. That is probably a couple of years away.

Meanwhile, I am wondering if there is any other drug combo that might help restore some hope. Please share if a certain drug combo that worked for you after Celexa + Trazodone. Thanks.",586

Stopped citalopram after a couple of years,"I‚Äôve been on and off antidepressants for the past decade.

I weaned myself off over a month until recently I have just stopped taking it altogether. I didn‚Äôt find it hard, though cutting my dose from 20mg, which I was on, to 10mg gave me some insane dreams at first. 

It has only been a few days completely off.

I find I am tearful easily, if I read something sad or think back to my dad‚Äôs death (he died while I was already on antidepressants).

Aside from just that, I‚Äôm so very numb towards anyone and anything. I have some feelings but for the most part, I‚Äôd rather be alone and am kind of pushing responsibility and people aside.

So my question was, at first i thought maybe 7,5 mg will work better for the apathy. But after a lot of thinking üòÇ (ADD)

Alcohol craving gone on celexa. ,"I've been on a journey over the last year to get a handle on my mental health. I finally asked for help via medication and my life is slowly changing for the better. 

I've suffered from anxiety and depression since I was a kid. I had a pretty traumatic childhood. But I never really knew what to call it until more recently. About 6 months ago I started taking Buspar for anxiety and it has helped me tremendously, especially at night. I used to toss and turn, and struggled to turn my brain off. 

While I wasn't having the sick to my stomach, panicky feeling anymore, I was still having a hard time coping with stress and self medicating with alcohol. I don't think I've gone a day without a drink in at least a year - probably longer. I didn't drink a ton, usually it was just a beer or glass of wine around 5:00 but I craved the buzz. And on the weekend I would regularly drink 2-3 drinks each day. I knew this was not a healthy habit in the long run. 

I recently asked my doctor about adding an anti depressant so she prescribed celexa. I've only been on it for a few days so far but my cravings are completly gone. I had a beer yesterday just in a social setting and could have gone without. I know it takes weeks for the full effects but I'm super hopeful with the results so far. ",595

I want to see if my hormones have changed in a way that is beneficial to where I no longer need meds. I feel like weight gain, low libido and brain fog are exasperated due to meds. I am still taking Wellbutrin daily. What I want to know is, how long will this dizziness/vertigo that I‚Äôm experiencing last? That‚Äôs my biggest symptom rn. I do feel weepy at certain commercials/videos and maybe a little irritable but nothing too bad so I feel lucky at this point.

Celexa Withdrawals?,"26 y/old female here... I forgot to pick up my 40 mg Celexa on Thursday and am on day 3 of no meds, I have been on 40 mg Celexa daily for probably about a year, prior to that I was on 20 mg daily for a while, but had started on 10 mg about 2 years ago.

Pretty much every month I forget to pick up my meds, usually I just experience some irritability and moodiness. This month, I started noticing some light headedness, heart flutters/palpitations, dizziness, nausea, brain fog/difficulty concentrating, tingly/numb extremities. These symptoms started about 30 hours after I had taken my last dose. This has never happened before when going a few days without my meds.

I thought it was just low blood pressure, but it's been almost 3 days of this now and the symptoms haven't improved or worsened. I went to urgent care yesterday but everything came back normal, blood pressure, BP, not pregnant, thyroid is fine, and all labs normal.

So basically, I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this with celexa withdrawal? I'm picking up meds today, so I'm hoping I'll see an improvement soon, but I guess just hoping I can chalk it up to withdrawal and stop worrying that I'm gonna have a stroke or something.",597

celexa or lexapro," hey reddit family, ive had 2 seperate cases of severe panic disorder for about 3 years on and off, i used to take lexapro on the smallest dose, 2.5mg and then 5mg and it really helped me overcome my disorder completely the first time (end of 2019 into 2020) but when i got panic disorder a second time (end of 2020) from smoking weed (how i got panic first time), I noticed not much of an impact on the same dose 2.5mg but i was told multiple times to up my dose for it and i was too scared to so i quit the medication cold turkey, and got insane migraines/headaches (thinking someting in my head was gonna pop it was so bad) as a withdrawal i think and for the past year I‚Äôve been medicine free but I still get panic attacks everyday (heart races everyday nonstop, evil bad thoughts), and I‚Äôm ready to get back on something, my doc prescribed me celexa but I‚Äôm very unsure about trying it Bc I‚Äôve been so used to take lexapro and i've been reading/watching other ppl's experience on celexa and the side effects and they seem a little more extreme but I‚Äôm just wondering what ur opinion would be, thank u so much for the help god bless!",612
From prozac to celexa,I‚Äôm being taken off 20mg fluoxetine an put into Citalopram because fluoxetine didn‚Äôt work for my depression and anxiety. Has anyone been through this? Did you experience side effects once again? What are the major differences?,613
Celexa vs Lexapro,"I‚Äôve been on lexapro for about 6 months and it‚Äôs helped me slightly with my anxiety but not my depression. I‚Äôve had pretty bad headaches since I started it, also decreased sex drive, and weight gain. I realize most of these things are side effects. I have been tapering myself off lexapro to start Celexa. I wanted to see if anyone had any feedback. I know everyone‚Äôs body reacts differently. TIA",614
Celexa and alcohol?,"I know you're not supposed to drink a bunch when on SSRIs, but I got really drunk last night and now I feel like I'm struggling to stay alive today. I have a major hangover and my depression is terrible. I have a lot of intrusive thoughts. Has anyone experienced this specifically on Celexa? I am having a hard time getting through it.",615
Celexa side effects anyone?,The first 2 weeks I had some nasty side effects which went away. Then I had an okay few days. Now at week 3 I am getting with extreme fatigue and drowsiness out of nowhere. The fuck happened? I won't be able to see my doctor for another week.,616
3 weeks after swtiching from zoloft back to Celexa and still have suicidal thoughts and increased anxiety coming in waves.,"About 3 months ago I decided to try zoloft after a few years on Celexa because of some physical side effects. I became suicidal and restless 2 months into trying zoloft and decided to swtich back to Celexa, It has been 3 weeks that I am back on Celexa and I still feel suicidal, hopeless, restless but tired with physical pain. I feel like I can't stop my negative thoughts. I never had suicidal thoughts before trying zoloft but t now it has become part of my life and Celexa is not working like it used to. I now wonder if it has anything to do with Zoloft or I am just going to be this way now. I have many ups and downs from anxiety to depression to suicidal thoughts and irritability. Anyone having had to go through the same thing?",617
Advice on anti depressants?,"I've been off anti depressants for about 5 years because the side effects of low sex drive  and ED just made me really unhappy anyway.

But as it turns out, those side effects are pretty much irrelevant for me now as the illness has basically stopped me me even trying to meet women, so what does it matter? I just want to feel better, so thinking of going back on the one I was on (cipramil) but wondering if there any suggestions out there about which anti depressants worked for you and which ones didn't?",618

Shortage of breath with Cipralex(Escitalopram),"Since a few weeks my problems with breath shortage have become worse.
I have raisen my dosage up to 20mg with permission by the psychiatrist.

I thought it may be related with long periods of laying down in bed, but I tried to walk everyday my 3000-5000 steps or something and (do some sports once a week), so I guess there is another main problem...

Maybe it can be related to some allergic reaction?
Does someone has experience with it?",623

I honestly dread taking the does. The side effects are a bit much. Not overwhelming but unpleasant. Walking usually makes me nauseous, even. Dizzy for several hours after taking the dose. Pins and needles. And very fatigued. I want to see if my body will adjust but I see no benefit to taking the medication
Please tell me it gets better.",626
Stopped taking escitalopram,"Hi all, I moved countries. Had to stop taking escitalopram bc doctor said I need to see a psychiatrist here to continue getting it. Too expensive. Thought I‚Äôm feeling better for long enough so stopped taking it. Here we are a few months later and I feel horrible. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs depression but I just feel so angry all the time. I get angry at every single little thing. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm angry at but I know it‚Äôs not fair on others. Don‚Äôt know I just want my pills back but that‚Äôs too much of a hassle and too expensive",627
I am taking escitalopram (cipralex) for 2 months now and I really want to stop,"Hello. 25M here, and I never in my life experienced a depression episode until 6 months ago because of a very tough breakup, 2 months ago things were at their worst with severe insomnia and anxiety attacks so i considered ssri because nothing else really worked. I got constant support from family and friends and that made me feel relieved. 

I was really scared of these pills at first, because I am the kind of person that reads the whole prescription to ibuprofen to see if it's fine to take it in certain situations, so started taking cipralex and nausea and numbness kicked in the first days. Then, after some time I started gaining weight even if I was running an hour a day. Time passed for 2 months now and I can say I really am the person I was before this pill with some sad episodes here and there that I had even before the breakup. The sleep is back the anxiety really is gone. 

But there some side effects to this pill that really scare me, i feel like an empty shell emotionless human right now, that cannot empathise enough as I did before, I do not feel any emotions before nor I can laugh or even cry a little bit like before. 

I know the minimum to feel better is 6 months, and my psichiatrist keeps insisting on taking them like they are candy, but I can't handle that because I am an outgoing person that wants to have fun and feel the joys of life as i felt before them. Summer is coming up and I can't drink an ounce of alcohol because of them, nor feel the laughter i had without them, because I know I was a happy person and I can reach back the way I was and even better.

So here is with the question, I really do not think this would give me another episode as I really do feel fine, I want to taper them already and leave them for good. I know myself and the kind of person I was before this breakup and I can say that I have found myself again. I know going cold-turkey is the worst thing you can do, so i want to tapper them as normal to not experience withdrawals. Do you have any advise on this?

10 mg escitalopram since 2008,"Hi! I‚Äôve been on escitalopram at 10 mg daily since 2008. I experience some degree of depressive thoughts and behaviors most weekends, though not all, and some circumstances of my life that I believe and hope will ultimately change are definitely contributing to this. That said, I‚Äôm open to the possibility that at least for a while either an increase in dosage, a switch to a different med, or the addition of another med could help give me some traction in my efforts to change things for the better for myself. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has been on a low dose of escitalopram for a long time and eventually made any of the aforementioned changes, and what your experience was.

kicking off escitalopram/lexapro and libido," 

hey guys, im completly free from escitalopram for 12 days now and i feel really good but my libido is still dead.  
I  know its super individual but isnt there like a rough timeline when it  should come back? i was on this med for approx. 2 years i think on 5mg.

some  people write it tooks years for them, some write it got back after a  few days, some write a few weeks and others say it never came bacfk and  they got the post ssri syndrome or whatever its called.

Its frustrating for me to have absolutely no clue when it rougly could come back or if its coming back in general. Im 25yo.

could you guys share your experience with or tell me a mostly common timespan when it should come back?

would be super thankful!",631

I've been on escitalopram 10mg for about 10 days because of depression and anxiety, and it's been fine when it comes to side effects, just had a few but nothing intense. I try to stay active working out 4 times a week cause thats the only thing that I can keep on doing and not feel overwhelm or more depressed, and also an excuse to get out of my house since I quit my job because of all of this and other reasons.
But since yesterday i've been experiencing a lot more blurry vision than normal and my anxiety went up. (I was on 5mg 3 days ago and upped the dose to 10mg as my psychiatrist told me to).
I went out today and because of festive days, i was in a place full of people, and i started feeling axious, dizzy, pressure on my head, and all the voices and noises felt extremely loud. A few years ago i've experience social anxiety and i know how it feels like to me, but it was never like this.

t‚Äôs helping me feel better I guess. it‚Äôs making me just not care and helping me to not ruminate‚Ä¶but I feel bad about not caring because I really should care more about all my relationship problems.

Lexapro for depression symptoms - ADHD/Anxiety/Depression,"Hi all, ADHD/Anxiety/Depression diagnosed here, up until now unmedicated. 

The past couple of months have been rough on my mental health which has led me to seek out medication for both my ADHD and anxiety - the anxiety prescription has been a lot faster to get a hold of. 

I've been put on Escitalopram/Lexapro for frequent panic attacks and anxiety, though I understand it's also used to treat depression?

For those of you who have been put on Lexapro, I'm really curious how it's affected you beyond calming your anxiety? I guess the combo of my ADHD+depression is responsible for my near inability to feel any dopamine from much of anything, so I'd like to know - has Lexapro increased your desire/enjoyment to do the things you couldn't normally bring yourself to do?

Increase Lexapro 10mg to 20?,"Hi!

I was just prescribed Lexapro 10mg. After a devastating loss, I‚Äôve been lying in my bed for 2 months. Apparently, I‚Äôve been depressed for many years but just forced myself to live with it until this event happened to me and opened up my eyes. 

Long story short, I have a history of mental illness (as does my family)‚Ä¶but apparently I‚Äôm pretty good at masking symptoms. I‚Äôve also had 2 concussions so living comfortably with this mind has been a bit challenging. 

I‚Äôm itching to increase my dose to 20mg. However, I‚Äôm obviously no doctor but I‚Äôve read that 20mg showed no more benefit than 10mg‚Ä¶.soooo. I took Paxil in high school but I felt no difference. Seems like every drug I take, I don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel a difference‚Äù.

"7 Weeks on Lexapro, could need some help. ","Hey guys,

I've found this subreddit since the beginning of taking antidepressants, and I have some questions, because my mind is going downhills. (Already have an appointment tomorrow, but I still need some help with those questions in order to classify them.)

I have Recurrent Depressive Disorder.

My problem with Lexapro: First time I took them, I felt dizzy, my nauseos, drunk. But I felt good overall. I guess the obvious symptoms were side-effects and the good feeling placebo. After around 2 weeks those side-effects vanished and the next 2 weeks everything went fine and I thought everything is going the right direction.

Saddly since week 6 everything goes downhill. I can't concentrate, I feel nauseous and huge appetite, I have anxiety (not severe, just a little bit over the whole day), my bad thoughts are back and I just don't feel great and worthless all over again. I lost my motivation for all of my hobbies, nothing is fun again and I feel like I am back where I started. I also have 0 energy for sportly activities and procastinate with a loooot of things again. I am always hot and I have trouble sleeping which is why I am taking Melatonin. I also started vaping alot (Don't know if nicotine is relevant for Lexapro tbh), which I didnt do before... in such a degree. I also lost interest in spending time with friends and it's not fun for me at all. I feel disconnected from everything. And overall my mood is rapidly declining... saddly.

I know that it can take 4-8 weeks to fully develop the concentration in your blood. But I feel like it went better just to suddenly go downhills in the matter of a week. Is it common ? Is it a depressive epsiode ? Do I need to go up with the dosage (currently on 10mg and started with 10mg) ? Or do I need to go down ? Do I need to switch the medication ? Or is it normal to feel like that after 7 weeks ?

\[I am in therapy, so dont worry about that btw.\]",650
switching from lexapro to pristiq,im currently taking 20 mg lexapro with 300 mg wellbutrin.... i've been on the lexapro for many years and don't feel it's working anymore. my psychiatrist recommended pristiq.. has anyone here had any experience with these medications? what was you**r** experience?

missing doses of lexapro,"i started lexapro about a month ago & have my next appt in four days, but have run out of my pills for now... i know i should call them to ask about it, so they can get me a new prescription if i'm not supposed to miss it but i'm so scared of calling that i'd much rather just miss the four days and talk things over on friday. just hoping it won't fuck me up too much because i have a presentation on wednesday... but i've only been on it for a month & not noticed many changes so far (except for libido & appetite), so i'm counting on not getting withdrawal symptoms either",652

One month in and I think Lexapro is saving me,"So I started Lexapro a little more than a month ago. For context, I have never been on an SSRI before and I have a depression and PTSD diagnosis. My psych warned me that starting it would be really rough and she was absolutely correct. The first week, I felt so sick I could barely get out of bed. The second week, I felt so mentally messed up and paranoid I completely isolated myself and was an emotional mess. For the last couple weeks things have been improving, but a lot of the side effects were still present. This completely changed a few days ago when I realized I have virtually no side effects. I have literally never felt this motivated and excited to be alive. I completely cleaned my apartment, got caught up on work stuff, and even planned a get together with a bunch of friends. I cannot believe how sudden it was. Wondering if anyone else has experienced such a huge 180 in their mood while on this med.",657

I went to my doctor with anxiety and sleep deprivation and he put me on Lexapro.  In my follow up visit , I told him I had felt numb, unable to express or feel anything and still hard to sleep. Over the next months he had me decrease , increase , and added ‚Äúadditional medication z I only stayed on the Lexapro. 2years! 

My boyfriend was frustrated with the mood changes , brain fog, my day napping. Usually he noticed when I forgot my pill or when we went out to drink with friends. 

I was ashamed of how the medication took over my life. I lost my job and my insurance a month ago. I stopped taking the lexapro cold turkey 2 weeks ago.  

I‚Äôm confused, have tingling hands, nauseous, irritated. Dizzy, I forget names, words, I can‚Äôt even walk or stand without spinning. Im choking when I eat. I can‚Äôt function!

I am just trying to not show it around him or our friends. 

But the worst part is that I‚Äôm severely depressed. I hide in the bathroom, or get up in the middle of the night, or say I‚Äôm taking a nap ‚Ä¶ just so I can cry. 

Tears just fall out of my eyes in silence. I feel so alone, so cold ( literally have chills) , I can‚Äôt breathe right, like silently I am hyperventilating, so sick of hiding. I want to scream in pain scream that I am suffocating!!! I think to myself‚Äù what can I take or do to just make myself stop breathing. ‚Äú? I have life insurance, no body checks on me, I am not getting any better. It is just getting worse every day I wake up. 

I find some people on here that share these feelings and I am wishing I could just hug every one of you that are feeling this way and are alone and suffering by themselves. Tears falling and no one there to hug you. 

I hope we can all feel proud for staying alive. I just want a hug so badly. Not a drink at a bar, not another pill, not a paid friend (therapist), just a real hug from a real survivor of this pain.

Trintellix and lexapro or seroxat! Help!!,"Hello, I am currently under psychiatrist supervision but I would like help with others experience. I have been on lexapro 20mg for a year now (after15mg for 2 years) and it stopped working. My doc suggested to add 10mg of trintellix. Read some reviews and were scary. 
I saw another psychiatrist, and she suggested I switch medic completely to seroxat (paroxetine) 10mg.
My GP said he would prefer I increase my lexapro 5mg.
I am lost and worried. 
I would appreciate anyone's experience with any of these. Been 2 weeks now with bad anxiety and I really should decide asap.
Thank you,",662
I am taking escitalopram (cipralex) for 2 months now and I really want to stop,"Hello. 25M here, and I never in my life experienced a depression episode until 6 months ago because of a very tough breakup, 2 months ago things were at their worst with severe insomnia and anxiety attacks so i considered ssri because nothing else really worked. I got constant support from family and friends and that made me feel relieved. 

I was really scared of these pills at first, because I am the kind of person that reads the whole prescription to ibuprofen to see if it's fine to take it in certain situations, so started taking cipralex and nausea and numbness kicked in the first days. Then, after some time I started gaining weight even if I was running an hour a day. Time passed for 2 months now and I can say I really am the person I was before this pill with some sad episodes here and there that I had even before the breakup. The sleep is back the anxiety really is gone. 

But there some side effects to this pill that really scare me, i feel like an empty shell emotionless human right now, that cannot empathise enough as I did before, I do not feel any emotions before nor I can laugh or even cry a little bit like before. 

I know the minimum to feel better is 6 months, and my psichiatrist keeps insisting on taking them like they are candy, but I can't handle that because I am an outgoing person that wants to have fun and feel the joys of life as i felt before them. Summer is coming up and I can't drink an ounce of alcohol because of them, nor feel the laughter i had without them, because I know I was a happy person and I can reach back the way I was and even better.

So here is with the question, I really do not think this would give me another episode as I really do feel fine, I want to taper them already and leave them for good. I know myself and the kind of person I was before this breakup and I can say that I have found myself again. I know going cold-turkey is the worst thing you can do, so i want to tapper them as normal to not experience withdrawals. Do you have any advise on this?

Tapering off Cipralex,"My psychiatrist told me to reduce the dose from 20 to 10 mg. I feel headache, anxiety, dizziness, shivering body, difficulty sleeping.

Shortage of breath with Cipralex(Escitalopram),"Since a few weeks my problems with breath shortage have become worse.
I have raisen my dosage up to 20mg with permission by the psychiatrist.

I thought it may be related with long periods of laying down in bed, but I tried to walk everyday my 3000-5000 steps or something and (do some sports once a week), so I guess there is another main problem...

Maybe it can be related to some allergic reaction?

"Nightmares from Cipralex never stopped, HELP!","For 7yrs now, every single time I sleep/nap I have incredibly vivid & intense dreams & nightmares. They‚Äôre unrelenting & super high anxiety producing or straight up disturbing & morbid‚Ä¶I wake up exhausted & at this point feel more affected by the quantity of dreams (it‚Äôs as if a part of me hasn‚Äôt shut off‚Ä¶like it‚Äôs being forced to watch these scenes each night without getting rest/turning off) than content as I‚Äôve become desensitized to the terrorizing scenes (always different & random).

  
7yrs ago I was put on Cipralex 10mg (Escitalopram) for anxiety & depression.

QUESTION: I've been prescribed both welbutrin and cipralex.,"I've been prescribed both for anxiety and depression and also got a third drug that is supposed to help me sleep - also an antidepressant - lexapro. 

I'm scared to take all three. The lexapro is prescribed ""take as needed,"" so I'm not sure why I have it. The other two though... 

Anyone else taking this combo? I'm using generics, but I don't think it matters.",670
Switching From Cipralex to Prozac...,"Hey all...

Been on 20mg Cipralex for approximately 2 months now, have been experiencing some pretty nasty side effects. Very shakey between pills, anxious, nervous to drive, very emotional. I also just completed a medical abortion, so I'm sure the hormones and stress involved with that wasn't helping either. 
Was finally able to get an appointment with my doctor last week (first chat since I started the meds) and she quickly decided to take me off the Cipralex and move me onto 20mg of Prozac, after a week of 10mg.
Wondering if anyone else has made this switch, or something similar? Anyone on Prozac have any tips /tricks for me? I'm just feeling alone, unsupported, and afraid... We all know the horror stories we've heard about Prozac üòï",671
Fluoxetine,Yesterday I started Fluoxetine and it's my first time being medicated. What's your experience with this med? How long until it started kicking in for you?,672
Fluoxetine ,"Reaching out to see who if anyone has had experience with the medicine fluoxetine, I believe it's Prozac. I have been taking this since my mom passed 2 yrs ago And honestly I feel no different at all. My doctor did say she would change it to something but the price after insurance is over $40 so I'm stuck on what to do.  Money is a big issue and cause of stress so 40 might not seem that bad to some but it kind of is a lot to me every month, Just wondering if people who have taken the pros at have good or bad experiences.. thank you for any advice ",673
Tiredness on Prozac/Fluoxetine,"Some information, I was diagnosed with depression in March and have been on 20 mg of Fluoxetine (my doctor recommended and prescribed the medication) since then. I take one pill in the morning as I was told to do and says on my bottle (and also keep in mind I usually wait until I have something to eat to take it because when I took it without food, it would make me nauseous), because I had trouble sleeping at night before I was medicated. I don't really have that problem anymore, however, now I find myself still being extremely tired even after a good night's sleep, sometimes I find it very hard to wake up and start the day, this is usually when I have days off work. Take for example, last night; I worked my shift until 11pm, came home and fell asleep around midnight, woke up at 8am and had breakfast, went to take my pill and ended up taking a 2 hour nap that I didn't intend to happen. I know depression can make you extremely tired, but am I still supposed to be this tired on SSRI's? (Also keep in mind, I did have blood work done before I was medicated to rule out any other health conditions that may have been causing my fatigue, said panels came back positive with no issues, especially for a thyroid issue) ",674
Prozac (Fluoxetine) or Cymbalta (Duloxetine),"Hi all, i am confused which one to start again.

Does someone experience with both and can explain what i can expect?

taking fluoxetine and driving?,"tl;dr-- can I safely drive upon starting fluoxetine (10mg); is becoming drowsy a common side effect?

just went to my (F21) first psychiatry appointment today, and my doc prescibed me fluoxetine for depression and anxiety. because I have never taken any meds before, she didn't prescribe me anything for my adhd yet, and she also put me on 10mg instead of 20mg because we aren't sure how it will affect me. I'm probably just freaking myself out over nothing lol, but I just picked up the medication from the pharmacy, and looking at the medication guide and reading online about this medicine, there seems to be a LOT of side effects (although I know not everyone gets them or to a very bad extent)! I'm most worried about the risk of driving-- I was told to take it in the morning, preferably with a meal, starting tomorrow, but tomorrow I have work and will wake up around 7am, eat maybe around 8am and would take it then, and will drive around 8:30am. I'll drive again at 2pm when I leave. I am slightly afraid that I will become drowsy at the wheel and won't realize until it's too late and something bad happens! Is it common at all to experience drowsiness immediatly when taking fluoxetine, and is it safe to drive and do other things on it, especially at the start of taking this medicine? 

I'll of course monitor how I'm feeling before I get in my car and if worse comes to worse, I'll just have to spend some money and grab and uber or smth, though I'd really rather not since it's so expensive! has anyone experienced drowsiness or difficulty driving at the start of taking fluoxetine?

Fluoxetine or pregabalin‚Äîwhich is making me feel so good??,"I started taking fluoxetine 5 months ago, and it's completely changed my life. I've basically been depressed since I was 15 (I'm 36 now), and this has made me feel happy, calm, energetic, motivated and hopeful in a way I never thought possible. I plan to be on it for the rest of my life.

BUT a horrible thought just occurred to me: around the same time I started fluoxetine, I also started taking pregabalin for nerve pain (75mg in the morning, 150mg at night). What if the pregabalin is the thing making me feel better? What if the depression comes back when my back heals and I come off it? I know I shouldn't be on pregabalin my whole life, nor do I want to be. I think it does make me a bit high and spacey. (But maybe that's the fluoxetine‚Äîwho knows?!)

Can anyone with experience taking both put my mind at ease? How did the effects differ for you? (FYI, I see pregabalin is sometimes prescribed long-term for anxiety, but I've always been much more depressed than anxious, so that's not a factor.) ",684

Stopped fluoxetine after 4 years - scary side effects,"I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was a teenager and it was very severe - I started taking fluoxetine in January 2018 and found that they helped balance me a lot. There have also been so many other major changes in my life though and in the past couple years I have felt like I am in a good place. I started considering coming off them within the last year as I never wanted to be on them forever. I decided to stop a couple months ago and I knew about withdrawal symptoms so made sure to ween myself off slowly. I was only on 20mg so not a high dose. I stopped taking it fully about 3/4 weeks ago. In that time I have become extremely low - I am regularly having suicidal thoughts which I haven‚Äôt had in years and I feel dissociated a lot. I have also been feeling dizzy but this could be due to other medication I am on for acne (lymecyline). I am feeling quite scared at how intense this reaction has been, I didn‚Äôt think this could happen if you came off of them slowly. I think I am going to have to start taking them again to protect my health, but that is really disheartening to me as I just feel like I am broken. I can‚Äôt comprehend how my brain chemistry without medication is so muddled. I don‚Äôt want to have to take them forever :(

Fluoxetine Increase?,"I was increased on my fluoxetine by 5mg on the 27th of July to 25mg. I lasted 13 days on that dose. I was completely bedridden from the side effects and anxiety it caused. I lowered to 22.5mg on the 11th. I felt better on that dose for a couple days and now I‚Äôm starting to feel the side effects again. Increased anxiety, nausea, no appetite, etc. Would it be safe at this point just to go back to the 20mg I was on? I can‚Äôt see a med providor until the 18th of September! 

Also, it it possible for someone‚Äôs body, over time, to require less of an antidepressant? I have been on fluoxetine for almost 10 years and it feels as if my body is rejecting it now. 

Any insight appreciated. Thank you.",691
Does Fluoxetine lower sex drive?,"I'm on a low starter dosage and recently I've noticed that I am shying away from sexual desire lately.

I got prescribed prozac along with therapy because according to my therapist it‚Äôs one of the few antidepressants that is compatible with my ED (i.e it‚Äôs not supposed to make you gain weight and it should calm the urge to purge).

Prozac losing its effectiveness quickly,"So I've been taking Prozac since February, and it has helped me greatly with my anxiety... After 2 months of 10 mg, then 20 mg, my anxiety got way better. I was more social, and I thought nothing was a big deal, and it even ended up getting me a boyfriend, although my emotions weren't as strong and I felt almost ""lazy"" but it was worth it. I used to be someone that stayed home all day and would rather be alone than spend time with friends but it completely swapped after increasing to 20 mg. The problem is, after this period, over the course of a week, I got really depressed and anxious and my mind was much clearer... I was worrying about everything and the whole world felt like it was crashing down on me. I talked to my doctor who increased my prescription to 40 mg, and it worked perfectly again, although I started getting some delayed ejaculation and ed. A month later, now May, I got the same depression and anxiety and my doctor prescribed me 60 mg... It helped, again, but now, I'm starting to get these symptoms again, and I don't know what to do. I can't keep increasing it forever, and I don't want my ed to get any worse or my emotions to be more blunted. Has anyone else had a similar experience to me and can tell me what has helped them? I was thinking of trying Zoloft and then adding Wellbutrin if my ed gets worse and my emotions are more blunted. ED sure is annoying at 18 with a boyfriend lol and these ""tolerance"" symptoms are honestly horrible. I also have asperger's if it matters",704
prozac flu,"I feel like shit ‚òπÔ∏è it‚Äôs my 8th day on prozac and I feel so achey, my sinuses are suffering, my throat hurts, and I can feel the lymphnodes in my neck are swollen.

i stop taking prozac cause i can't get hard,"please help idk what to do anymore, i start taking prozac consistently for the first time in may and surprisingly my mind did get clear i used to think all these meds is bullshit but they actually does help yo actually numb my mind and i did getting better when i was taking it.

However, my sex drive has become so low. I can't get fully erect at all and i don't feel any horny feeling anymore...i don't even get fully morning wood when i wake up im scared that this will be permanent n i might suffer from erectile dysfunction...

Prozac is really making me worse right now,"I have heard the warnings, the period it takes for the medicine to work can be even worse that how you were before, but I didn't expect it to get this bad.

Mood swings on Prozac,"Hello all, I've been lurking around here for some time now. I figured somebody has gone through this before.I was put on generic Prozac and trazadone about a month ago. The last couple weeks my lows have gotten lower, and my anxiety has spiked a few times worse than ever. I'm trying to work with my psychiatrist but it's gotten to the point where I'm pretty sure it's the medication, at least the prozac making it worse. Is this normal? Has this happened to anyone before? I've always been up and down but I feel like the medication is making it worse and I'm not sure what direction to go in, nor do I know anyone thats had this severity happen with them, so I guess I just want to know other people's experiences with this? Thank you all",708
I think prozac is making me more depressed/suicidal ,"I have a really hard time understanding my emotions, I always did, but right now from my understanding I'm feeling more suicidal/depressed 

I was laying in my bed and I imagined how the rope would feel on my neck while I was choking, how painful it would be etc..... I have never actually really thought about doing it, but it has always been in my mind as an option 

I've been doing prozac for 7 days now , online I read that until it takes effect (in about a month)I might even feel worse, so I guess this is what's happening right now , but if it's gets too bad I will contact my doctor 


Luckily I haven't had any other side effects perhaps insomnia but that's it, no dizziness or tiredness nothing 

And I do understand that each antidepressant will work differently on everyone so maybe this one isn't for me, you kinda become a guinea pig until you and your doc figure out what's working I guess ü§∑",709
Weird side effects from tapering off Prozac?,"I have been tapering off prozac (40mg) - 3 weeks I reduced to 20 mg, 2 weeks on 10 mg. I am getting weird side effects:

- muscle aches 
- ear pain - like tinnitus
- headaches - feels like my whole head is super tense, eyebrows, behind the eyes, behind the head...
- extremely tense jaw - I started to get clicking in the morning
- tender breasts - even after my period?!?!
- tiredness - I am sleeping a lot and I need a nap in the afternoons

Are these regular side effects from tapering off? should I continue with the plan (2 more weeks on 5 mg, and stop after that)? or should I stay on the same dose?

I was aware that I would feel a bit off, probably headaches and upset tummy, but I feel this side effects are making me miserable and are interfering with my daily life.

Thank you in advance ",710
Can't get prozac refill for two months,"I've been off Prozac for about two months now and my doc won't refill until I have an annual exam but has no appointments available until about two more months from now.

Do you have any advice for me about getting a refill OR some sort of OTC alternative to help?",711
Vyvanse and Prozac - safe to mix?,"I‚Äôve been on Prozac for about 5 years now, 40mg daily to treat chronic depression. I‚Äôve always struggled a lot with fatigue but lately it‚Äôs gotten even worse, I‚Äôve had blood tests and a sleep study and there is nothing physically wrong. 
My psychiatrist has prescribed Vyvanse (50mg daily). She thinks it will help with my energy levels and curb binge eating (also struggle with this at times).
I don‚Äôt have ADHD, is it weird to be prescribed this? Everything I read online is conflicting - I‚Äôm worried about adding an amphetamine into the mix and never being able to come off it. I‚Äôm also worried about serotonin syndrome.

Does anyone take this combo and how has it been for you? ",712
My zoloft experience vs my prozac experience,"   I started taking zoloft at the age of of 16 from constant over stimulation that had started once i hit puberty at 11 years old. The first few months on zoloft i felt happier than i had ever felt before to a pretty extreme extent. I didnt know this was an odd reaction to ssri‚Äôs especially since up to the age of 16 i had never done any drugs. I hadn‚Äôt ever even had caffeine before besides the low amount in soda which I rarely ever had. The reason im saying this is because there were nothing in my life i had experienced that was mind altering. This is why i didnt know at the time that i was really, really high on zoloft. Apparently it was obvious to my family who have said it was very obvious something was wrong once I started. I became the most extreme extrovert anyone could ever become. This all lead to me going from a normal 3.0 gpa to graduating with a 1.8 gpa. I became a drug addict in the worst way possible. I had become so impulsive. I went from being a kid who never lies or does anything bad to the guy who lies for no reason. I became a poly addict within months of starting zoloft. I became completely disconnected from not only friends but to my parents as well. This continued for 2 years until i finally stopped taking it at 18. Once i stopped taking zoloft i did a complete 180, well sort of. The addictions i picked up on zoloft for the most part stopped, except for one drug which i still struggle with. That being adderall and vyvanse. Thank the lord i never met anyone with meth during this time. There were other drugs i was addicted too as well while on zoloft like oxycodone, hydrocodone, weed, nicotine, xanax, Klonopin, alcohol and even more. I was addicted to all of these. I couldnt stop thinking about getting high. Its all i thought about. Always thinking of ways to get drugs. My parents had to buy a safe specifically for there prescriptions to keep me from stealing them. Even my own zoloft was in there safe because i would take 4 a day when i was prescribed to take one 50mg. I even abused tylenal(acetaminophen). My parents also couldn‚Äôt keep alcohol anywhere in the house since everynight after they went to bed i would search the whole house for it. 

     Like i said though once I turned 18 i stopped taking zoloft and just like that all of my hyper focused drug cravings went away, all of them except for amphetamines which i still struggle with today. Also this isnt really related but when i was 19 i tried molly(mdma) with a friend which i had only had gotten because i started abusing amphetamines again which for some reason amphetamines also make me impulsive, but not to the same level as Zoloft though. Anyways when i took the molly, guess what it felt like?!  It was literally the exact same head space and just over all feeling i had during the first 6 moths on Zoloft. It felt exactly the same, just it only lasted for a few hourse and made me very umm aroused, and a bit hyped.

 Im about to turn 21 in 7 days so it really hasnt been to long since my manic days.




Second time on ssri‚Äôs

 Right around when i had turned 20 i began getting my first ever panic attacks. Most of them were the normal panic attacks, well normal probably isn‚Äôt the right word. I mean most of the attacks i had i could deal with on my own since they all happened at night when i was alone. One night though that changed. This particular night i felt that dreadful anxiety which i had been feeling for the past couple weeks already but it had never gotten to the point where it was too overwhelming for me deal with on my own. I was just laying in bed going to sleep, then it just happened in less than a second i knew i was gonna die. I knew this was it. I couldn‚Äôt breathe or i guess i could breathe but for some reason every time i would inhale it was just like i wasn‚Äôt idk. That immediate overwhelming feeling of death is the worst pain i hade ever felt. Worse than any physical pain id ever had, well i guess its the worst thing i‚Äôve ever felt period at least at this point in my life. Because of this i went to the doctor. I refused to take ssri‚Äôs for it while also really trying to stay away from benzodiazepines for obvious reasons. So i perscribed Buspiron which is kinda in its on catargory. It‚Äôs non addictive and its not an antidepressant. So I took it for just about a month. Made me lowkey feel like shit. Constant headaches along with being really hot which is kinda problem since i work physical labor pretty much only outside all while it‚Äôs july. So unfortunately the only other option was ssri‚Äôs since im still on my parents health insurance my mom would never in a million years allow me take benzodiazepine which is obviously understandable. So i get a script for prozac cause it‚Äôs not Zoloft so maybe it‚Äôll be a little different. Boy oh boy was it different. So basically the prozac ended up doing exactly the opposite of what the Zoloft did. I became more depressed than i had ever been by a landslide. Legit would fantasize killing myself. The first two weeks on prozac i would do nothing. Like straight up nothing but think about how amazing it would be to get relief by  meeting up with my favorite tree. Eventually it went away for the most part. Then i stopped taking it 3 moths ago, so i was on it for 9 months total. I just felt normal on it for the most part. The only other thing it did that was bothersome was make me a little short tempered.


  Ive just been curious if anyone else has experienced something similar to me.

I resumed taking Prozac,"I decided to go back to Prozac as I have a test on March 24th 2024 and I need to study for it.

Prozac (fluoxetine) is making me more depressed than ever,"This is a pure rant, no valuable information

It honestly wasn't that bad before I took it but now, I'm nonstop depressed. I haven't thought of suicide so much ever since middle school. I can't get out of bed, I'm tired, irritable and I cry constantly. It's honestly exhausting. But my psychiatrist told me to not get off it yet, to see if it'll get better.

Reaction to Prozac and at a loss for new med,"I‚Äôve tried cymbalta, Zoloft, ability, trintellix and Prozac. Most recently I had a reaction to Prozac with odd head feelings and body sensations. Now I‚Äôm scared of what to try next. Nothing works. I wish there was an answer. :(

"vaping, prozac and derealization","So I've been taking prozac for around a month now and it triggered frequent feelings of derealization. I'm a quite heavy vaper and have been for around a year. I know that it's an unhealthy coping mechanism but I found that the nicotine helps with my anxiety quite significantly. However, recently I've noticed that when I get a nicotine rush, especially in the mornings, it worsens the feeling of derealization. Has anyone here had a similar experience? I've struggled with periods of derealization before but something like this has never happened before. I am expecting the advice here to be telling me to quit but I genuinely don't think I'll be able to in my current state as I'm still recovering from the worst episode of my life.",717

Withdrawal from Clonazepam and Paroxetine,"I‚Äôve been on clonazepam (1mg) and paroxetine (37.5mg) since a year. Over the last few months we started to taper the medication to wean me off of them. Currently I‚Äôm weaned off Clonazepam entirely (SOS only) and on 25mg of paroxetine. Here are the symptoms I‚Äôve been experiencing since the last few weeks, and they only seem to be getting worse. 

Insomnia, mania, feeling hyperactive, loss of appetite, recklessness, impulse control, thrill seeking. 

Lately I have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts as well. The feeling of helplessness is so intense, I‚Äôd do anything (including ending everything) just to make it stop.

Some sexual dysfunction during paroxetine weaning,"I'm an early 30s male and I've been taking paroxetine for about 6 years now, during most of which I took a dosage of 50mg. Besides never having felt it interfered with my libido, it actually had the side effect of making me last longer. But since my weaning process started approaching its end (currently at 6mg), my interest in sex has been spotty. In addition, my erections lost some strength and I've been lasting only a fraction of what I used to. My last three encounters didn't even involve penetration because of this. These effects are way less pronounced if I'm masturbating, which shows it's mostly a mental barrier.

I've mentioned these problems to my psychiatrist, but he's been somewhat dismissive of them. Has anyone been through the same? When did things normalize? Should I start doing some kegels?

Feeling negative symptoms after lowering paroxetine dosage,"My daily dosage before October 2023 was 20 mg.  
  
I alternated daily between 20 mg and 10 mg starting in October 2023.  
  
Every day from November to January, I took 10 mg.  
  
I wasn't very affected by the dosage reductions before.  
However, as of February 2024, I alternate between taking 10 mg and 0 mg every day, and I've been feeling terrible.  
I have such a poor appetite that I can hardly eat. Extremely uninspired and always worried. difficulty getting out of bed.

Paroxetine withdrawal,"If this is incoherent, that's because it's 4:30am and I feel like hell.

I'm coming off 30mg paroxetine and straight into 20mg fluoxetine (prozac) as directed by my GP. No slow taper, just straight switch, and oh my god this is torture. I've done cold turkey switches from other SSRI's and they were all fine, if anything they were kind of fun. But this? Pure evil.

The cold sweats, dizziness, constant brain zaps, my whole digestive system purging itself, the god awful *nausea*. The only positive is that my mood is improving already - when it's not distracted by everything else.

I'm going into day 5, third day of these symptoms, *please* tell me it gets better from here.

UPDATE: i'm going back to the doctor and stopping this. i've taken half my old dose for now. maybe its in my head, but its already a bit better. to anyone finding this in the future, it's okay to find this impossible. you're not a coward for being beaten by it. shit's rough.",723

First dose of paroxetine euphoria?,"I am well aware that medications like this should be nearly undetectable immediately but this is my second time starting paroxetine and both times within an hour I felt slightly euphoric. 

When I search for this, I either get pages and pages of one of two things- paroxetine should take weeks to have an impact and negative side effects.

Because I did a lot of research before ever considering anything, I had no expectations that would allow this to occur as a placebo and after digging and digging I will see someone mention this happening to them and no one will have replied with a reason or a similar experience but I‚Äôve found a handful of individual events of people mentioning this.

I‚Äôve gotten the breakdown of why it is not supposed to work in that manner but I‚Äôm curious if anyone has any theories or further understanding that might explain what could cause it to occur? 

I should add that it seems like I am one of the cases where paroxetine works with me really well with minimal side effects except the first time I started this med, I had a moment of depersonalization- I woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and I had this overwhelming feeling of knowing that I was looking at myself but it wasn‚Äôt really me and I hysterically cried until I fell asleep but when I woke up it was gone.

This is more of a mission to find a viable explanation so I am okay with educated guesses lol",728

First paroxetine dose euphoria,"

Hello, 21yo male here diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression and was prescribed paroxetine 20mg.

I took my first dose today after being super anxious about it. 

The first 20min were anxious as hell but then, anxiety went away and since then I've been euphoric, happy, very energetic and most importantly no anxiety at all. I also went for a drive and was driving pretty recklessly ( more than usual)

I don't have any side effects other than maybe blurry vision.

Is this normal? To feel something after first dose? It cannot be placebo, I have taken drugs in the past and I definitely felt high.

Paxil withdrawal,"Been on Paxil 50mg/day for a bit over a year now, switched psychiatrists and she was appalled at the amount of meds I was on and has had me stop a couple (adderal and clonazepam), taper my Paxil and start Abilify (I‚Äôm also on 100mg of pristiq a day but she left that alone for now) . I haven‚Äôt started the abilify yet cause I‚Äôm already struggling so much with withdrawal symptoms from the Paxil. (My ultimate goal is to be on as little medication as possible) 

I‚Äôm familiar with brain zaps and ssri withdrawals but this is a bitch. I just started a new job, how the fuck am I supposed to function . Everytime I move my head there‚Äôs buzzing and it looks like stop motion everywhere. Things don‚Äôt feel real or familiar, I want to self harm to make sure I‚Äôm real . I‚Äôve almost broken my phone today multiple times because I‚Äôm consumed with such absolute rage I chuck it across the room and then just immediately fall apart sobbing and trying to think of ways to make myself unconscious so I can stop dealing with this constant back and forth.  Someone looks at me the wrong way and I‚Äôm convinced they‚Äôre targeting me, I get pissed.  Constant urges to hit things, smash my head against the wall, scratch my skin open, coupled with the random bouts of rage right now is making it so hard to just exist and not traumatize the ppl around me.  I feel like I could snap at any moment and I almost want to to just get it over with. 

Med withdrawals are one thing but I feel like I‚Äôd  have to put my entire life on pause to be able to manage this shit without losing my job, losing friendships, upsetting my wife, ruining everything we‚Äôve been working towards.

Zoloft vs. Paxil,"I am currently on a number of drugs for anxiety/depression and PTSD.  I take 400 mg of Seroquil along with 150 mg of Setraline (Zoloft).  I currently take 2 mg of Ativan every morning and 200 mg of Bupropion (Wellbutrin) after lunch.  

I feel like I have made improvements in my life and the drugs have helped but I still feel pretty intense pain/discomfort in the morning  and night.

I feel the usual withdrawal symptoms and I just finally got a refill on my prescription. I did some research on Paxil withdrawal and I‚Äôm genuinely mortified. Everyone is saying it‚Äôs dangerous to go cold Turkey. I even read that someone picked up a guy who was having a seizure from his withdrawals. I don‚Äôt plan on quitting cold Turkey but even to taper off??? People are saying it‚Äôs horrible. I‚Äôm so so so afraid of dying as it is and I was never warned about this when I was initially put on Paxil. I‚Äôm angry and frustrated and scared. I don‚Äôt want to be on Paxil anymore but I don‚Äôt want to fucking die? Like I‚Äôm genuinely mortified. Any suggestions? Do you guys think I‚Äôll die or have a seizure from quitting Paxil?

a little story of my journey with depression and treatment,"I was studying in Malaysia after graduation, but then I returned to my country, Libya.

Now I feel mentally stable and happy most of the time. My sleep is restful, and I don't experience insomnia. All in all, things have gotten better for me.",747
23F am I just never going to get better?,"So I have had depression professionally diagnozed and started taking fluoxetine since I was 13 years old. I believe I had it when I was 12. The amount of happiness I feel daily is considerably smaller than it should be or what it appears like on other people. I have zero motivation or aspirations I don't have dreams I'm insecure I hate myself no matter what I do (includes exercise diet which led to anorexia then bullimia but I was able to get out of it). I have since been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and anxiety disorder. My depression is extremely severe and when I have episodes I become suicidal to the point of needing hospitalization. Ive been to the psych ward 3 times now and after each time I went through a 6 week long therapy thing which would start at 10 am and end at 4 pm. Ive talked to over 10 psychologists and had different therapists. I was prescribed seroxat but later switched back to flux as my depression episodes would last longer and longer. The only cure I found to get out of an episode is to take sleeping meds and sleep and sometimes I sleep for  3 days to feel better. Im also taking lyrica and contraceptives (for pain) that I just switched to. I know the episodes come from my bpd, but it is agonizing to not have a reason to be sad and feel completely awful. I don't know how much longer I can suffer through those episodes. Ive become a drug addict since drugs are the only thing that give me some feeling of happy /creates dopamine? Even when everything is going well I get severely depressed and suicidal. Is there anything I can do at all? What helped me was exercise but I cant motivate myself to do anything anymore. When it gets bad I stop showering, brushing my teeth or my hair, my room gets disgustingly messy and I isolate I just don't feel like being with anyone cause nothing makes me happy and it seems pointless. I was in a great relationship but I was so depressed and deep in drug addiction it lead to a breakup and a meltdown for me and i was hospitalized again. I went to rehab too. Literally nothing helps me I cant work or study my mind just tells me it would rather die and I get stuck in idle positions for hours. I dissociate often and I have had suicidal thoughts every day my entire life. Should I just end it already? My mom is the only thing that is stopping me I don't want to hurt her. Ketamine helped me but I started abusing it too. I dont know what I want or need from life its like Ive seen and felt enough and I want to leave I dont really have any close friends either they all just seem to leave eventually. Any advice helps ",748
Sertraline,I'm on this medication 100mg for a week and the sexdrive is uncomfortable. Cant ejaculate. What now? Sorry for the question but it is just unbearable.,749
Is sertraline that useful?,"There are times when, after taking my medication, there are milder emotional low points, however, it seems that life is cruel on purpose. 

I've imagined me in some way committing suicide, or dying in some painless way to transcend from this world, or tragic play I can't even focus on my tastes and hobbies, I don't know how to drive, I don't have a house or anyone to share it with. I feel alone, weak, internal and part of a monotonous world. I want to get off of it.",750

Since quitting, I‚Äôve struggled reeeally badly with petechiae, INTENSE full body itching and even more random bruises than usual. 

I‚Äôm also suddenly extremely hyper-sexual after basically growing my virginity back over the last two years.

Do you guys have any experience with these *possible* side effects? 
It is summer, so it‚Äôs possible the itching is just allergies, and the other stuff can probably be explained away too which is why I‚Äôm asking.",752
Sertraline Numbness?,"Whether I have the most ideal day possible (or inversely, the least ideal), I am left numb.

It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve laughed deeply or cried hard. There is just a numbness that lingers covertly behind me no matter what. I‚Äôm having a hard time experiencing emotions like I used to.

For instance: when I spend time with my most cherished loved ones, I have a hard time relating to their emotions. I try to be conscious and remind myself of how I would normally react (pre sertraline) in order to relate.

Anyone else? How do you cope?",753

Is zoloft (sertraline) making me dead inside?,"I have been on 25mg zoloft (sertraline) since past 6 days, and I just feel distant and disassociated from reality.

I mean I am still doing all those things, still cuddling her, being next to her, but not because I want to, but only because I am supposed to. Because that is how we‚Äôve lived since forever. I do not suddenly want to distance myself and make her feel less loved or distant at all.
I love her to death, but why do I feel less in love?

I do not want to be emotion less. Why is this thing making me less loving? I do not want to kill all my feelings.

"1.5 Months With Sertraline 50Mg (29 M)
    ","Hello all, I (29M) was diagnosed with depression and anxiety on May. I've been taking 50 Mg Sertraline since then.

Side effects kicked in 3 days later and they were not major. Only mild tremor, nausea, low libido, impotance and excessive yawning. Never effected my everyday life.

I have anxiety about the future,socializing, creating bonds,gf etc. for almost like 3 years. I am not looking for a job,not taking initiative to socialize and almost always procrastinating. Even now. I have to study for my exams but instead of doing so here I am :D I am not leaving home at all unless someone invites me. And my social circle is too small. I am not even trying to meet and know new peaple. Not to mention about my sex life :)

All of these had to make me feel bad and trigger/enhance my depression but for the last 2-3 weeks I just don't care. I don't feel the stress of not doing anything. This is okayish in short term but when I think about the long term, I see no change in my life.

2 weeks later I have an appointment with my doctor. I think she will prescribe me with higher dose. Also, I am thinking on getting therapy for at least once a month.

Could you share your experiences and coping mechanisms with me?",763
Long term sertraline withdrawals?,"Hey guys,

I tapered off in around March of this year and had a couple of weeks of nasty symptoms, they went away and I thought everything was okay.

Then around May this year I started getting extreme nausea, GERD like symptoms, acid reflux, chest pain, headaches, general stomach pain and bloating. All nasty stuff thats really effecting my quality of life and mental health.

I am awaiting a referral for a gastro specialist in the UK but looking at 1 year wait (cheers NHS). But will be going home to Australia in a month to be seen straight away so until then ill just have to deal with the symptoms.

I just started Sertraline,"like literally a few hours ago I took my first pill and I feel sick, how long does that feeling last? is it normal to feel it so soon?",765
Sertraline,"I got prescribed sertraline by my doctor today and I'm kinda on the fence about taking antidepressants but considering the long wait I'm currently enduring to speak to a therapist and how shite I feel at the moment when the doctor suggested it, it felt like it might be worth giving it a go. 

Is there anything I should be wary of with them or am I being a bit needlessly wary about them?

I read the warning sheet thing (instructions? Manual? I think I've forgotten the right word for it) and it said that I shouldn't drink when taking them but also that you shouldn't just stop taking it and that you should taper off. I'm going away at the end of October and was hoping I'd be able to have a drink whilst I'm away. Can I stop taking them for a few days and then start again when I'm back or is that going to cause me problems?",766
Stopping Sertraline,"For two years I have been through a nightmare with Severe anxiety and depression being re- prescribed Citalopram having been on a maintenance dose for 20 years . Post Covid I was first tried on Mitrazipine then Sertraline.
After 12 months on 50 mg to 200 mg I got worse the more I took . I have having a medical background reduced it over two weeks to 100 mg and I feel absolutely brilliant but still shakey for first few hours . My QUESTION is do I reduce it further and hope I can stop it as I don‚Äôt want to use it if possible .",767
Going from Sertraline to Citalopram...,"So, just over a week ago I was put on 50mg Sertraline (Zoloft) after deciding to take control of my depression after years of just ignoring it. Anyway a serious relationship ended and it hit me bad, made my depression worse to the point where I was suicidal. I was put on the meds and instantly noticed a massive difference. All my negative thoughts went and I feel so much better too. My doctor says that's unlikely as it can take weeks for it to kick in, is this true? Is what I'm feeling a placebo effect?  


Also, Sertraline gave me really bad restless legs on a night to the point where I've been getting no more than 2 hours sleep a night, so she switched me to 10mg Citalopram...What should I expect from switching? Will it take another 4-6 weeks to kick in? I was only on Sertraline for a week.

sertraline and mental fog: how to cope with work?,"Hello everyone, this is my first post on Reddit, so far I have only read other people's posts but today I thought I would share something to feel less lonely.

I've been on sertraline for a week now, it‚Äôs my first time (after years of psychotherapy which lately wasn't working anymore). I'm being treated for depression and anxiety, mild alcoholism and addiction to pot (plus occasional use of other substances). The doctor prescribed me 25mg of sertraline in the morning for now (I should increase to 50mg next week) and 1.5g of Bromazepan in the evening. After a few moments of euphoria from sertraline, when I finally felt good after months of feeling like shit, I am now experiencing unbearable mental fog and fatigue, especially during the day (it gets better in the evening). So I wanted to ask if anyone had similar experiences and how you managed to go on and wait for these side effects to pass. On some things I already see some progress, for example I no longer have obsessions or suicidal thoughts and I've stopped drinking and smoking after years. Anyway, I have job in which I have to stay focused and use my intellectual/creative skills, and mental fog and fatigue make it really hard for me to do that.

I also wanted to ask you if you shared something about your treatment and/or condition with your colleagues to make sure they understand what you are going through and accept that you might be less ""productive"". I am very undecided about it because my working environment is generally quite judgmental and competitive (which is disgusting, I agree), and it is not easy to take some time off when you want without being left behind.

I finally decided to see a psychiatrist because I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and was slowly destroying myself, although very few people know about my mental issues and addictions. I somehow managed to hide it outside my inner circle while things kept getting worse inside me. I had a surprisingly successful career until now in spite of a though personal history (I have experienced SA and other kinds of violence within the family when I was a child) but things seem to be falling apart right now, after years, and I don't if this sertraline thing will help or just give me another problem to solve... 

Thank you for taking the time of reading me. Stay strong and safe!",771
Sertraline isn't working anymore (Rant),"I started taking 15 mg of Sertraline around July 2023... I upped the dose to 25 after 2 weeks. About a month later, the dose upped to 50mg. It was steady 50mg until about a month ago, when it started working less and less. I upped the dose to 75mg, then I started having constant nightmares, so a week ago I went back to 50mg. The depression is showing thru the meds again.

I'm sorry if that's difficult to read\^

(Rant)

I feel like I'm struggling... The past few days my depression has felt so much worse, little things just make me want to break down. I got pushed in the hallway today and fell on the floor (accident) and I had to try my best not to cry. I got hit in the head with a chair leg (accident again) and also had to try not to cry... the jerk got mad at *me* for being upset *he* hit me with the chair :( 

To make it worse, randomly I either feel numb, or I feel upset for little to no reason. I think this is affecting my boyfriend. He tries to ask what's wrong, and he tries to cheer me up, but sometimes it just doesn't work. I feel really bad because I feel like I'm making everything about me, and he's focusing too much on making me feel better... so I am not checking up on him as much. 

Sorry for this rant, just needed to get it out. Thanks for reading. ",772

Feeling stuck on Zoloft for life,"Long story short, I'm a 34yr old female. I've been on Zoloft for 6 years. After I sobered up from opiates and alcohol and was struggling with the worst depression I'd had ever experienced. I was tried on Prozac, Cymbalta, and one other antidepressant that I can't remember. The only one that seemed to work was Zoloft. I was on a very high dose of 150mg for a few years and eventually have worked my way down to 50mg. 

I've been on 50mg for a good year or two now, and recently went down to 25mg with doctors permission as I have had emotional blunting and no sex drive which is frustrating to say the least. I noticed within the first week of decreasing to 25mg that I was becoming overly emotional and tearing up over situations that were very minor. Figured it was my body adjusting so I stuck to the 25mg. It's been about a month and a half now and I've been feeling no motivation to go to work at a job I don't even work full-time at, want to sleep all the time, and just feeling general depression come back, with no increase to my libido. 

I see my doctor in a week to discuss what to do, but has anyone has success with another antidepressant that is similar to Zoloft? I feel like maybe trying a different antidepressant may be worth a try, but I also am fearful of going back into a deep depression. It seems like I can't find a happy medium on my antidepressant. I am also on Vyvanse 50mg, Suboxone, and Clonazepam all under the close supervision of my psychiatric doctor. 

I'm not looking for any medical advice but looking to see what other's have had luck with.

Switching from Zoloft to Lexapro to Wellbutrin,"Hello, I (21F) had my first experience with antidepressants in the form of (25mg for 2 weeks then 50mg) Zoloft beginning 5/3/24. A month later, I switched to 10mg Lexapro cold turkey due to my provider‚Äôs recommendation because I wasn‚Äôt feeling better. Another month later 6/4/24, a new doc suggested I switch to 150mg Wellbutrin cold turkey 7/9/24 since I didn‚Äôt feel much different on Lexapro either. This doc said since I didn‚Äôt have any withdrawal symptoms cold turkeying from Zoloft to Lexapro I should be fine doing the same Lexapro to Wellbutrin. Today is my fourth day of being on Wellbutrin and I can positively say I feel significantly worse. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs symptoms of withdrawal or the Wellbutrin.

Experiences Adding Wellbutrin to Zoloft,"Adding Wellbutrin to Zoloft 
Hey everyone!
*** I need positive stories please!!!!! ***

I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for 7 years and have been struggling with very low energy/motivation/dissociation/numbing for quite a while. I went up to 100mg and literally couldn‚Äôt cry for years. Two years ago I went down to 75mg and then 62.5mg to just yesterday 50mg. The other problem is I still have horrible anxiety. I get terrified of going out with people and often talk myself out of it. If I do go my anxiety completely dominates the whole experience. My anxiety manifests physically a lot. I start getting hot, thirsty, nauseous. Ugh. It‚Äôs dumb. I felt like my anxiety should be better if I have to deal with all the other side effects of this med. 

Anyway, I put off making med changes bc years ago I had a psych that basically took me off Zoloft cause I had RLS and tried like 4 diff SSRI‚Äôs, SNRI‚Äôs, beta blockers, antipsychotics, etc. over the course of like 6 months and it was a horror show. It was so traumatic to me I‚Äôve been terrified to try anything again since getting back on Zoloft. I never felt the same I first did on Zoloft but it was enough to stick to it.

I finally got the courage to find a good psychiatrist and explain the fact that I still feeel like my anxiety and depression is quite unmanageable as it holds me back from doing things. A lot. She recommended I go down to 50mg on my Zoloft and add Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm so nervous bc I feel like I always get the worst side effects and experiences and meds never work out for me. I can‚Äôt afford to have even worse mental health. I know I can just get off of it if it doesn‚Äôt work out, but I‚Äôm afraid it will permanently alter me. Kinda like before when I mentioned I was on a lower dose of Zoloft, tried a million meds and ended up having to go on a higher dose of Zoloft cause it wasn‚Äôt doing the magic it was before. I keep reading that Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt good for anxiety. My psych swears the Zoloft will counteract that. I‚Äôm just nervous. Zoloft already gives me a weird dissociative feeling that freaks me out and gives me anxiety and I‚Äôm afraid Wellbutrin will exacerbate it.


So I guess I‚Äôm asking‚Ä¶ has anyone who really struggles with anxiety and depresssion been a really tough pickle / prone to bad experiences with meds and had a positive experience with this combo??",788
Going back onto Zoloft after 7 months,"
I‚Äôve had the worst 3 weeks I‚Äôve ever had when it comes to anxiety and depression. I was on 50mg of Zoloft from 18-26 so a big chunk of my life. I was mentally stable and decided to come off, which was actually a success story. I tapered off properly and had no side effects and felt great for 7 months! I recently have had a bit of a breakdown after I had a bad hangover with anxiety and haven‚Äôt been able to recover since. 

I still feel myself some parts of the day but I can‚Äôt shift my racing thoughts. Anxious for no reason. Feel paranoid/overthinking about the most stupidest stuff which makes me think I am going my crazy (but I don‚Äôt truly believe it the thoughts???) if that makes sense.. that gives me some hope. I‚Äôve googled everything for the last 2 weeks and thought I might slip into psychosis (I can deal with physical anxiety but if it‚Äôs another to do with mental being I really struggle to come back to calmness) I feel detached and feel like I‚Äôve got some sort of DPDR during times. This has all escalated within 17 days. It‚Äôs been a spiral! I have no interests or emotions most of the time, I use to love watching TV shoes and gambling on sports but I‚Äôve had no urge to do either. I have just been rotting away

I spoke to my doctor today and expressed most of what I‚Äôve been experiencing and we both came to conclusion I should go back onto Sertraline. 

First time around the side effects was awful. I literally didn‚Äôt leave my bed for 3 weeks and even after that I done the bare minimum. It was actually hell. I am so lucky I don‚Äôt have a job at the moment and don‚Äôt have to worry about financial stress. 

I am wondering if anyone has come off sertraline and then faced just as bad side effects as the first time you was on them.  It‚Äôs so hard to think straight when you are in this state of mind. I feel hopeless and have no trust in anything.

zoloft brain fog,"It's been a full year since I began taking Zoloft for my depression and anxiety. Around this time in 2023, I left school and moved online, which I ended up dropping out of too. Thus, becoming a living zombie wasn't an issue when I would do nothing but rot in bed. I stopped replying to all of my messages which cut off all contact with my friends. The point is, I'm back to online school now, and the inability to focus is insane. I could read the same sentence a thousand times over and still not comprehend any of it. I don't even have the motivation to live, so getting back into the habit of doing normal things seems impossible right now. I'm exhausted all the time, I have no friends, and I frankly do not care about my future at all. I'm financially dependent on my parents and I'm unable to get a job for the same reasons I can't go back to school. They've given me a full year of being on meds whilst allowing me to do absolutely nothing with my life, so it simply isn't an option to continue living the way I have been. And I know that this isn't something that you can recover from magically with some time and drugs, but I just can't rid myself of this guilt. It feels like time is finally catching up to me and I don't know what to do.",790

Is zoloft (sertraline) making me dead inside?,"I have been on 25mg zoloft (sertraline) since past 6 days, and I just feel distant and disassociated from reality.

I am a very loving person in general. I love my pets and wife. I cuddle and kiss them all the time. I am clingy, I try to be with my wife as much as possible and now I JUST DONT WANT TO? WHY?

I mean I am still doing all those things, still cuddling her, being next to her, but not because I want to, but only because I am supposed to. Because that is how we‚Äôve lived since forever. I do not suddenly want to distance myself and make her feel less loved or distant at all.
I love her to death, but why do I feel less in love?

I do not want to be emotion less. Why is this thing making me less loving? I do not want to kill all my feelings.

Please tell me this goes away. My doctor has asked me to up my dose to 50mg in the next 10 days and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll become a robotic zombie, and ruin all my relationships.",792
Zoloft vs. Paxil,"I am currently on a number of drugs for anxiety/depression and PTSD.  I take 400 mg of Seroquil along with 150 mg of Setraline (Zoloft).  I currently take 2 mg of Ativan every morning and 200 mg of Bupropion (Wellbutrin) after lunch.  

I feel like I have made improvements in my life and the drugs have helped but I still feel pretty intense pain/discomfort in the morning  and night.  

I was thinking about substituting Paxil for Zoloft as I was on Paxil for about 20 years before weaning off it two years ago-I thought it was helpful.  At this point I‚Äôm trying to tweak things in the hopes that I feel better.  My question is I was wondering if anybody has had success with Paxil and not Zoloft? Or should I not bother given they are both SSRIs?",793
I go down from 200mg of Zoloft to 150mg,"so I go down from 200mg sertraline to 150mg, also doctor moved sulpiride 50mg to zero. I'm feeling fine and I think this was a good idea. I don't know if I will have any problems coming off 50mg of sertraline, but the psychiatrist told me that there won't be any problems. So there you have it, has anyone else lowered the dose and what were your experiences?",794
My zoloft experience vs my prozac experience,"   I started taking zoloft at the age of of 16 from constant over stimulation that had started once i hit puberty at 11 years old. The first few months on zoloft i felt happier than i had ever felt before to a pretty extreme extent. I didnt know this was an odd reaction to ssri‚Äôs especially since up to the age of 16 i had never done any drugs. I hadn‚Äôt ever even had caffeine before besides the low amount in soda which I rarely ever had. The reason im saying this is because there were nothing in my life i had experienced that was mind altering. This is why i didnt know at the time that i was really, really high on zoloft. Apparently it was obvious to my family who have said it was very obvious something was wrong once I started. I became the most extreme extrovert anyone could ever become. This all lead to me going from a normal 3.0 gpa to graduating with a 1.8 gpa. I became a drug addict in the worst way possible. I had become so impulsive. I went from being a kid who never lies or does anything bad to the guy who lies for no reason. I became a poly addict within months of starting zoloft. I became completely disconnected from not only friends but to my parents as well. This continued for 2 years until i finally stopped taking it at 18. Once i stopped taking zoloft i did a complete 180, well sort of. The addictions i picked up on zoloft for the most part stopped, except for one drug which i still struggle with. That being adderall and vyvanse. Thank the lord i never met anyone with meth during this time. There were other drugs i was addicted too as well while on zoloft like oxycodone, hydrocodone, weed, nicotine, xanax, Klonopin, alcohol and even more. I was addicted to all of these. I couldnt stop thinking about getting high. Its all i thought about. Always thinking of ways to get drugs. My parents had to buy a safe specifically for there prescriptions to keep me from stealing them. Even my own zoloft was in there safe because i would take 4 a day when i was prescribed to take one 50mg. I even abused tylenal(acetaminophen). My parents also couldn‚Äôt keep alcohol anywhere in the house since everynight after they went to bed i would search the whole house for it. 

     Like i said though once I turned 18 i stopped taking zoloft and just like that all of my hyper focused drug cravings went away, all of them except for amphetamines which i still struggle with today. Also this isnt really related but when i was 19 i tried molly(mdma) with a friend which i had only had gotten because i started abusing amphetamines again which for some reason amphetamines also make me impulsive, but not to the same level as Zoloft though. Anyways when i took the molly, guess what it felt like?!  It was literally the exact same head space and just over all feeling i had during the first 6 moths on Zoloft. It felt exactly the same, just it only lasted for a few hourse and made me very umm aroused, and a bit hyped.

 Im about to turn 21 in 7 days so it really hasnt been to long since my manic days.




Second time on ssri‚Äôs

 Right around when i had turned 20 i began getting my first ever panic attacks. Most of them were the normal panic attacks, well normal probably isn‚Äôt the right word. I mean most of the attacks i had i could deal with on my own since they all happened at night when i was alone. One night though that changed. This particular night i felt that dreadful anxiety which i had been feeling for the past couple weeks already but it had never gotten to the point where it was too overwhelming for me deal with on my own. I was just laying in bed going to sleep, then it just happened in less than a second i knew i was gonna die. I knew this was it. I couldn‚Äôt breathe or i guess i could breathe but for some reason every time i would inhale it was just like i wasn‚Äôt idk. That immediate overwhelming feeling of death is the worst pain i hade ever felt. Worse than any physical pain id ever had, well i guess its the worst thing i‚Äôve ever felt period at least at this point in my life. Because of this i went to the doctor. I refused to take ssri‚Äôs for it while also really trying to stay away from benzodiazepines for obvious reasons. So i perscribed Buspiron which is kinda in its on catargory. It‚Äôs non addictive and its not an antidepressant. So I took it for just about a month. Made me lowkey feel like shit. Constant headaches along with being really hot which is kinda problem since i work physical labor pretty much only outside all while it‚Äôs july. So unfortunately the only other option was ssri‚Äôs since im still on my parents health insurance my mom would never in a million years allow me take benzodiazepine which is obviously understandable. So i get a script for prozac cause it‚Äôs not Zoloft so maybe it‚Äôll be a little different. Boy oh boy was it different. So basically the prozac ended up doing exactly the opposite of what the Zoloft did. I became more depressed than i had ever been by a landslide. Legit would fantasize killing myself. The first two weeks on prozac i would do nothing. Like straight up nothing but think about how amazing it would be to get relief by  meeting up with my favorite tree. Eventually it went away for the most part. Then i stopped taking it 3 moths ago, so i was on it for 9 months total. I just felt normal on it for the most part. The only other thing it did that was bothersome was make me a little short tempered.


  Ive just been curious if anyone else has experienced something similar to me.

Withdrawls from vraylar and Zoloft?,I‚Äôve been on 1.5 mg vraylar and 75 mg Zoloft for depression for about 3 years. The Zoloft never really did much but when I added vraylar everything changed and I felt myself again. I‚Äôve been perfectly fine for over 2 years now. I just switched insurances and vraylar isn‚Äôt covered on it and I ran out of my script and don‚Äôt feel like paying for them. Also don‚Äôt like the idea of taking daily medication of any kind at such a young age (26). I have been off of them for about a week and half. Feel pretty good except for  occasional brain zaps throughout the day and brain fog. Also just feel the slightest bit off in general. No depression tho.

But Zoloft left me with no sex drive and I couldn't orgasm at all. 

So my doc stopped Zoloft, started me on Wellbutrin. 

Orgasm and sex drive came back (maybe even better than before)

My problems were not solved.

After using this medicine for a while, we doubled the dose, but it made me feel sleepy. We went back to the first dose and added wellbutrin, then I stopped the first drug and started taking wellbutrin 300 mg.

Switch from duloxetine to trintellix,Hey all I‚Äôm looking for people who have experience from directly switching from dulox to trintellix. I was on 30mg dulox for the last 4-5 yrs or so and felt pretty good on it. The only downside was I couldn‚Äôt stand the excess sweating and living in the south with a fully outside job..the sweating became very bothersome. I told my psych and he had me directly switch to 10mg of trintellix about a week and a half ago. I definitely feel more irritable and haven‚Äôt felt much motivation to do things (but it‚Äôs hot as hell here so I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs just the heat bothering me or not). I‚Äôve just kinda felt extra‚Ä¶‚ú®spicy‚ú® this week especially and I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the medication switch or just me reading into things too much. The nausea has not been fun to deal with but has been better over the last few days. Today I couldn‚Äôt wait to get off work and go and be alone. I was done with the bullshit from work and felt like if one more thing happened I would chew out the poor soul who put the final nail in the coffin. HOWEVER I was also hungry.

Duloxetine experience,"I have never posted here before but I feel like I need to share this with someone... even though it's more challenging than usual to form coherent sentences.   
About four hours ago I have taken duloxetine for the first time (60mg). About two hours ago I started to feel just... *very weird*. The state that I'm in isn't something I've experienced before and it's difficult to put into words. I feel a bit anxious and agitated and I feel chilly even though it's warm. I was in the middle of a meal when the effect started to set in and my appetite has since been wiped out completely. I'm somewhat beside myself as if my mind is starting to trail off but it doesn't quite do so. Half an hour ago I felt as if I'm close to having a panic attack but luckily that has since faded.   
I'm reminded of the first and only time I have taken bupropion several years ago. Back then I woke up in the middle of the night while feeling a huge surge of fear and desperation. I'm worried that duloxetine might lead to something similar. I'm now scrambling to look up other people's experiences after they initially started taking the drug. Some don't describe any negative side effects whatsoever while others seemingly had experiences that were similar to my own or even much worse. What I haven't figured out yet, is if the initial discomfort eventually made way for the positive effects that these people were hoping for or if those sensations are a sign that someone doesn't tolerate duloxtine.   
...   
I took a break typing and the feeling has since warped into a strange sense of excitement and restlessness before changing once again... now I feel distracted and exhausted.
Unfortunately I can't really talk to a professional about this since the drug was prescribed to me by a general practitioner.",814

Cymbalta Withdrawals,"Hey people. This is my first Reddit post and I wont lie desperation has brought me here.

  
I have been on Cymbalta for 2.5 months now, and just recently upped my dose to 60 mgs. I haven't felt any side effects other than sleepiness for the first bit and loss of libido, which was nothing I was too worried about..... until I missed a dose. I was at around 24 hours between doses. When I woke up, I was really sick. Sweating, puking, headaches.... pretty scary not going to lie. So, I've now decided I'm going to taper off and stop taking it, so I've lowered my dose to 30 mgs..

  
**My question to everybody is if they have ever experienced flashbacks/memories that you are unable to piece together? False memories maybe? Confusion?** Its hard to describe. I have a thought or a memory and when i focus on it,it's gone. I'm not even sure if these memories are real. I also feel as if i have tunnel vision when it happens. 

  
The first time couple times I had to lay down because I felt sick and started sweating like crazy. Now its kind of reoccurring couple times an hour. I have nausea and an ongoing head ache, but the confusion and flashbacks/memories have been really really freaking me out. It's only been 2 days on 30 mgs.

Cymbalta with Ritalin for adhd & depression ,"Recently started Ritalin 20mg 2x a day to help with adhd and chronic fatigue. I‚Äôve been on Vyvanse before as well but didn‚Äôt work out for me. Also started Cymbalta/duloxetine (generic) 2 days ago, today is the 3rd dose. Taking it for depression. I‚Äôve tried an antidepressant before that was prescribed as an off label non stimulant for adhd, but reacted badly to it. 

I haven‚Äôt had any side effects or weird symptoms, except for maybe an up and down. I‚Äôll feel good and energized then sluggish/groggy. Haven‚Äôt noticed any reactions with Ritalin either so far.

I do notice a bit of an intense/overwhelming feeling, not in a bad way. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but whenever I yawn or feel sluggish/tired, I think the Cymbalta tries to fight it and uplift my mood. Gives me a big boost of something, like a feel good energy but it‚Äôs intense. 

Also have a bad addiction to caffeine, especially soda. Mostly Mountain Dew and Dr Pepper. I try to cut back and wait for have one at least 6+ hours after I take Cymbalta and in between Ritalin doses. 

Definitely too early to tell if it‚Äôs good or bad.

I weaned off it for 2 weeks as reccomended by my doc, and I stopped taking it 2 days and started venlafaxine. have been crying on and off all day. I can barely stay awake during the day because I‚Äôm so exhausted from feeling sick. I‚Äôm borderline about to quit my 3 week old job because I‚Äôm so sick and I can‚Äôt do anything but lay here and try not to keep throwing up. I can‚Äôt even have my camera on in meetings because I‚Äôm walking away at least every hour to go to the bathroom. I can‚Äôt stop shaking and I can‚Äôt sleep for long because I wake up from nausea. I called my doctor begging for some solutions but he said it could last for months and there is long term withdrawal symptoms for 44% of patients. I never would‚Äôve taken this medication if I knew. I start actually taking calls for my job Friday but I can‚Äôt do that. I can‚Äôt like this. I‚Äôm crying over everything. And my job is such a mess and so unorganized right now. I‚Äôm ready to quit but if I quit I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôll find another job. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve never been so desperate. I just want to die",828
duloxetine (cymbalta) experience?,"I‚Äôve been taking this for a few weeks and tbh the only noticeable change is having no appetite whatsoever. Besides that, I feel the same with no other noticeable side effects. This is my first antidepressant.

I was just wondering about other people‚Äôs experience (negative or positive)",829
Cymbalta,"Holy hell. I‚Äôm weening off 120 mg of cymbalta. I started the higher dose over a month ago and I‚Äôve had horrible side effects. I‚Äôm going down to 90 to start. It feels like hell. I have brain zaps. The fatigue is actually unbelievable. I can‚Äôt get through a day without a long nap. It‚Äôs so depressing. Just washing my hair is a huge task.
I have all the bad side effects unfortunately. I have a really sensitive system. I am so anxious, so clammy, exhausted, dizzy, nauseous, no appetite. I‚Äôve been living off chocolate milk honestly. And trying to eat more fruit which I have. I just can‚Äôt believe this path I‚Äôm going on yet again to find the right medicine for me.
I am so paralyzed I can‚Äôt bring myself to do anything. No work, no chores.
Thankfully I was prescribed a sedative to help curve the symptoms and calm me down. Otherwise I‚Äôm literally just sitting on my couch, staring at the same show that‚Äôs always playing but not really watching it because I‚Äôm so in my head. 
I have to say I‚Äôm already feeling better. I was feeling extremely suicidal when I was on 120 mg a day. More so than in my entire life.
I just needed to vent to a group of people who actually understand and are willing to hear me and maybe relate to each other?
I have support in my life. But the support from these communities on Reddit still touch my heart.
Does anyone have any similar situation?
I‚Äôve tried many meds in the past that don‚Äôt work for me. Not sure what I‚Äôll do once I‚Äôm off completely. My doctors hoping 90 mg will even me out but I don‚Äôt think so",830
Tapering off cymbalta and upping Wellbutrin,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone has had experience with this combination.
I have been on 20 mg cymbalta for half a year. I did not like the blunted emotions of it and did little for my fibro pain. We tried increasing cymbalta to 40 before and I had extra joint pain reaction so we went back to 20.
I suffer from real bad chronic fatigue so in conjunction of cymbalta I take 150 mg xl of Wellbutrin. Lately I felt like I needed a boost in energy so we upped the dosage to 300 mg xl 
I noticed it helps my depression immensely but the anxiety is fucking horrible. Hopefully this subsides in 3 to 8 weeks. 
Now I‚Äôm weaning off of cymbalta while upping my Wellbutrin dosage. My dr added gabapentin to be taken every night as additional therapy for the anxiety/depression. 100 mg 
I haven‚Äôt tried the gabapentin.
I don‚Äôt want to take too many drugs while doing all this and am afraid of serotonin syndrome. 
I decided to push thru symptoms and wait until 2 weeks when I‚Äôm completely off cymbalta so that I may try gabapentin. 

Man ive been tempted to take gabapentin to ease into the adjustment.

What should I do?",831
Cymbalta 30mg,"I've been on 30mg of Cymbalta for quite a while now, at least over a year. I was on 60mg for a little bit soon after I first started talking Cymbalta, but I felt like a zombie and even more unmotivated than before I took it. I have a lot of health problems and keep getting more. Lately I've been really passively suicidal. I have NO PLANS to commit suicide. It is very passive. I just wish I could go to sleep and not wake up to my health problems and struggles and depression. It is the worst it has ever been but I am not at all planning on committing suicide. Having a lot of passive thoughts about it does bug me and has gotten worse lately, including my depression/anxiety getting worse. I know I need to go back up to 60mg because I can't say the medicine isn't working and I'm not even on the highest dose. I've tried  a handful of different antidepressants in the past and had lots of side effects and/or they didn't seem to help much. Are my main choices to keep feeling super depressed and passively suicide or be a zombie on 60mg? I mean, I could try another med but Cymbalta seems to have agreed with me the best so far. I have chronic pain/nerve pain/Fibromyalgia. I know 60mg is the clinical dose for helping pain issues. Pain issues aren't my biggest complaint health wise right now so having the 60mg mostly for helping with chronic pain is not at all my biggest concern with upping my dose.",832
Cymbalta weight gain,"Hey there. So my doc started me 2 days ago on cymbalta 30 mg. I‚Äôm very healthy but I fear weight gain, is that a common side effect of cymbalta a itself?

Switching to cymbalta from Lexapro,"Hello.  I am switching to cymbalta from lexapro, after my lexapro pooped out and my depression and anxiety came roaring back.  He wants me to do a direct switch.   Has anyone done this?  How long did it take for the cymbalta to start kicking in?  Is it still the full three-four weeks?  Thanks a lot!",834
Cymbalta/Duloxotine withdrawal: Suggestions for dealing with the symptoms or speeding up?,"28 yr old female who has been on Cymbalta for about 6 years to treat Generalized Anxiety disorder and Fibromyalgia symptoms. I was taking 60mg twice per day and then was only taking one 60mg once per day for 2 weeks as suggested by my doctor before starting a new antidepressant prescription: 10mg of Aventyl to eventually get up to taking 5 10mg pills per day. 

The reason I wanted to switch to a different antidepressant was because if was no longer working for me. 

I thought I was dying or losing my mind or something until I Googled how long duloxotine/Cymbalta withdrawal can last and apparently it can be up to 3 or even 6 weeks! It's been only one week. I told my doctor about my concerns about the withdrawal symptoms from the times I've run out in the past and that's why we tapered the dosage but... obviously it didn't work. 

My withdrawal symptoms: 
.

. Insomnia. My ADHD symptoms are so much worse and my brain won't shut up and let me fall asleep. When the insomnia goes on for too long I start to disassociate and have difficulty determining if I'm awake or sleeping. Things get trippy while awake like I'm wearing someone's glasses or looking in a fun house mirror. Sometimes its like I'm stuck in the Dolly zoom camera effect in movies where I feel like I should have physically reached somewhere by now...
.

. Severely vivid nightmares when I do manage to fall asleep every single night. Sometimes they will wake me up in a full blown Anxiety attack. I'll also wake up drenched in sweat and my entire body clenched tight. Even when I run my air conditioner as low as it can go in my room in hopes of it helping me have a deeper sleep, I can wake up drenched in sweat like I was in a sauna.
.

. Exhaustion from the lack of sleep, causing significantly worse ADHD symptoms, worse anxiety symptoms, causing very low mood and no motivation to do anything. I could burst out I tears over the tiniest provocation right now. 
.

. Diarrhea and indigestion. Either the stress and my whole life being out of whack is causing my IBS symptoms to flare up or its happening on it's own. I could eat something like beets at a very late lunch at 2pm and see the beets again at 7pm. Nothing looks fully digested. 
.

. Nausea, indigestion and bloating is making me very hesitant to eat at a regular schedule. 
.

. Vertigo/lightheadedness/tinnitus. Ps, this is not exactly textbook symptom and when the problem starts up again it is a bit of a mystery. Had seen a ENT and had an MRI a few years back to try to figure it out but there was no obvious cause. Essentially I get a pulsing feeling in my ears and a high pitched bell ""üéµbringggüéµ bringgggüéµ"" sound in my ears like an old fashioned telephone and sometimes my eyes flicker like the lights are dimming during a storm or power outage..... but this happens specifically when my eyeballs move side to side but not up and down.... this symptom might just be a coincidence too. Very light vertigo, mostly foggy lightheadedness. 



The insomnia, nightmares and diarrhea are the biggest problems right now and its making me beyond miserable and feeling like I'm losing my mind. 


Please, any suggestions? I want to wake up from this nightmare.",835
Cymbalta and Extreme fatigue & Sleepiness,I‚Äôve been taking Cymbalta for the last 7 years and have been ok but for the last year I‚Äôve been so sleepy and tired and would often sleep till 5pm on weekends. I don‚Äôt feel sad or depressed I‚Äôm just exhausted and don‚Äôt feel like doing anything. I feel like I use to have a drive but I just feel nothing now. I guess this is better than being super depressed but I don‚Äôt want to live like this either. Should I ask my doctor to change my antidepressant?

Cymbalta - weening down,"Has anyone else experienced the horrible side effects of this medicine?
I was on 120 and now going to 90 mg because I could not function on it. I‚Äôm currently so paralyzed and can‚Äôt move.
It‚Äôs just been a week that I‚Äôve been taking the 90. I know it takes a lot of time. I read online it could take months to get things stable again. It just really sucks. It‚Äôs doing more harm than good and I have to wait and do it in increments in order to go back to normal self. I find it comes in waves. It‚Äôs very intense today.

Any advice?

New insurance denied my Cymbalta,"I hate this. Every time I have to switch insurance, I have to jump through hoops to prove I need a brand name medication. I‚Äôve tried the damn generic. I was suicidal on it. But they insist on trying again. 

Has anyone switched from Cymbalta to generic Effexor? I‚Äôm essentially going to have to to prove I need something that keeps me sane and alive. 

I just want to cry.",838
Cymbalta stopped working?,"I started Cymbalta 2-3 years ago, I don‚Äôt even remember, for dysthymia and major depressive disorder. Originally got put on Effexor, but I was given 100mg straight away and had like a full ass range of emotions from panic attack to uncontrollable bouts of laughter in a 24-hrs period so I never took a second dose. 

A lot of people take antidepressant and talk about having symptoms where they feel numb or muted emotions. My issue is I was ALREADY feeling that. That‚Äôs my normal state. So I guess the cymbalta was supposed to be something that helped that. 

It did seem to work at first, my mom told me she noticed a difference. But I have found myself not noticing anymore. It‚Äôs like I slipped back into depression. I‚Äôm still quick to get angry, anxious, annoyed all the time, and get depressed thoughts. I have trouble concentrating, I dissociate. I‚Äôve also gone from 100 pounds to 170, which seems extreme. So my self image is in the toilet. But I‚Äôm currently in a graduate program and I‚Äôm afraid of the withdrawal completely destroying my ability to function. I‚Äôm also scared that maybe my depression will get worse and I‚Äôll just flunk out of the program. But I‚Äôve essentially pushed myself away from everyone and already feel burnt out anyways. Looking for advice.",839
21M Cymbalta sucks,"I've been taking cymbalta (duloxetine) for about 3 months, 60mg. In just 3 months I've gained around 45 pounds (20kg), and I have stretch marks on my hips and other parts of my body. Now, recently, I've developed a strange lump on my left chest that hurts when I touch it, and it all seems to be pointing to Cymbalta as the culprit, too.

On the other hand, It may have helped with my depression and anxiety. I don't wake up hating myself every day and night. I don't usually have negative thoughts anymore. But getting out of bed is still a really, really hard thing to do, and every now and then I get very anxious. My social anxiety has not decreased a lot, I still get super anxious when around and talking to people.

Man, it really sucks to be in that minority of people that gets these rare side effects. Most people say they actually lose weight. And I'm only gaining weight, despite eating moderately, just like I did before the treatment.

I'm thinking of giving up on this drug because I don't know if it's worth it.",840

Venlafaxine(Effexor) is the devil,"
TL:DR
 I‚Äôm going cold turkey on this because it ruins my life

Hello guys üëãüèª
I‚Äôm diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression and was put on Venlafaxine a lil bit more than half a year ago. Little to say it numbed all my emotions it also numbed my sexual drive, sexual functioning and libido to non existent. As a person with extremely high sexual drive I felt even better at first. First time in my life my horniness doesn‚Äôt control me and my mind. In the emotion aspect I didn‚Äôt feel really a significant change, that‚Äôs when I told my doctor I think we should try something else. Instead she increased the dose and I was put on 225mg. I met a very nice girl recently (around 1.5 months ago) and we started dating very seriously. We felt very emotionally connected - same interests, hobbies, etc. We have met almost every other day. First time in my life I felt so connected to a human being. When it came to bed she said she doesn‚Äôt feel any sexual chemistry between us - oh boy she was right, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything - let alone ejaculate or to even maintain an erection. I decided to go cold turkey on this devil med a few days ago and I‚Äôm already starting to feel better sexually. Today the girl decided to end our relationship because as I said she thinks we are not sexually compatible. And I feel like I potentially lost the love of my life thanks to a stupid med.
I opened up to her about this problem a few days ago but I don‚Äôt think she realised to what extent my sexual drive was off. It was literally in shambles.
I don‚Äôt know what to do now, no way I‚Äôm taking this med ever again, I don‚Äôt recommend it to my worst enemy‚Ä¶

This is the 4th antidepressant that I‚Äôve been on and I‚Äôm really over this process. Lexapro worked so well for me but I couldn‚Äôt control my bowels‚Ä¶ I feel like I‚Äôm at the end of my rope. My doctor made feel confused I guess? I feel like I can‚Äôt keep asking for a new medication but I know I have to. Idk I guess I‚Äôm venting. When did a medication start working for you?

Wellbutrin or venlafaxin/ effexor for depression? ,"I have depression and struggle to have any motivation to do the things that I used to do before.

I also have adhd.

My doctor put me on wellbutrin 100 mg xr. I was feeling okay on it, but anxious and more scattered with my adhd. Wellbutrin has helped me wake up in the morning and I fall asleep better than before, but I feel different in my head, like sometimes I have a head high. 

My doctor suggested I double my dose and see how I feel in terms of my concentration, because I was feeling more scattered than normal on the 100 mg. I did that today and took 200mg and felt better/ more concentrated during the day, but super emotional at night and I was agitated throughout the day. 

I am wondering if wellbutrin just isn‚Äôt for me and have been reading about effexor as an alternative to wellbutrin. 

Has anyone had experience with both drugs who can comment on what‚Äôs the best course of action? 

Thank you",849
Drinking in moderate amount is helping me with Venlafaxine Withdrawls.,"I was put on venlafaxine and mirtazapine about an year and a half ago. It initially helped me and got me through the worst time of my life. Now, i am sick of it. The combination of this medicine leaves no energy in me. I was completely numb and had no motivation to do much. I felt that it had turned me into a completely different person. And also, i was gaining a lot of weight. About a month ago, my doctor told me to quit mirtazapine. Initially i was prescribed 7.5mg and I had to take it before sleeping every night. 

When i stopped taking mirtazapine, it was hell. The insomnia kicked in and I was unable to sleep. The next, I drank like 5 bottles of beer. I would like to mention that I am not a hard drinker. I've tried vodka 2 or 3 times and other stuff with more than 40 % alcohal and I hated it every time. The smell of it makes me go beserk. But, I enjoy occasional beer normally on the weekends. So long story short, when i was going through mirtazapine withdrawls, I drank those 5 bottles of beer and the next day, I stopped feeling any withdrawl symptoms. 

  
So now i am trying to come off of venlafaxine as well. The maximum I ever took was 75mg and then for the last 5 or 6 month, I was taking 37mg. It's been 48 hours till I took my last dosage. I am unable to focus. My brain is going haywire. I am having really bad lucid dreams. I am thinking of going to buy some beer and drink to ease the symptoms. Even 5% alochal, that you find in a typical beer, is a lot for me, because mainly, I am preety sure, none in my family tree has probably drank any alcohal for atleast more than 1000 years and even i tried it at the age of 29. Have any of you ever tried this approach? Could it be just a placebo? Do you guys think is it dangerous ? I dont know what should I do to make these symptoms stop. I am never touching these meds again ever in my life. ",850
Venlafaxine or quit,"I have been on some form on antidepressant for three years. I was originally told I would only need to be on them six months and here I am still on them. I felt really good on lexapro, but had gained about 30 lbs and so my doctor and I thought, since I was doing well, I should wean off. Oh my word, I had the worst withdrawl symptoms despite tapering my medication for months. I am a mom to four kids and the withdrawls were making me super angry and yelling at then a lot. I was also experiencing depression and suicidal ideation. Physically, my skin was crawling all the time and I had terrible insomnia. At that point, my doctor decided to put me back on an antidepressant. We decided on wellbutrin because it is weight neutral. Well, I am not tolerating the wellbutrin very well and so my doctor wants to put me on venlafaxine. I am scared that I will gain a bunch of weight again and have serious sexual effects. I want to be in a good place, not only for me, but for my family, but I am tired of dealing with the side effects of antidepressants. I am unsure if I should just wean off of the wellbutrin because it's not an ssri and because it supposedly is less likely to cause withdrawl symptoms or if I should just start the venlafaxine. Have you experienced anything similar. What were your situations and experiences like?",851
Venlafaxine side effects.,"Just switched from Escitalopram to Venlafaxine in this last week and yesterday I doubled my dose for first time.

I was really emotional and overly stressed about work and super tired from a relatively stressful week, but in the afternoon I got so stressed and upset I felt like I was having a meltdown. 

I‚Äôve never had an SNRI before and I‚Äôm wondering if the boost in norepinephrine is what stresses me :(

Venlafaxine: changing my mind,I‚Äôve been on venlafaxine for over 4 years. I started at 75mg but am up to 150. I recently have started to feel like it isn‚Äôt helping the problem.

"Venlafaxine withdrawal, does Mirtazapine help?",I'm unintentionally out of venlafaxine but I have some Mirtazapine from when I was worse in a nightstand. Does it help with the Venlafaxine withdrawal symptoms? I'm taking clonazepam as prescribed and added a dose because of these symptoms but they are getting awfully worse and I will not be able to go to the pharmacy to buy some more because of my symptoms and I'll have to wait for my gf to get out of her university class.

Just quit Venlafaxine without seeing a doctor. Any advices to the withdrawal?,"I‚Äòve been on Venlafaxine 150mg about half a year now, but as the time went by, i heavily lost appetite and ability to sleep regularly. I noticed, that both appetite and regular sleep are essential to me, because i get psychotic tendencies without. So i quit the medication and feel better now on day 4 without Venla. Withdrawal symptoms are around since two days and i know it‚Äòll probably get more intense in the next weeks, so i decided to ask you, if there are ways to make the withdrawal more endurable. Thank you kindly",856
Thoughts on Venlafaxin?,"Antidepressants are and have always been only a last resort to me. I would try everything else before resorting to pills.

Now I have been taking Venlafaxin for about a year four years ago. I remember it helped me to snap out of the really dark time and then it did stabilize me for the following months, although I can't ever be 100 % sure it was not a placebo effect. 

Long story short: I feel like Venlafaxin did help me initially, a lot, but then after a year of taking it I felt very dull and I was worried the Venlafaxin started changing my personality and because I wasn't too eager to be dependent on taking a pill every single day just to function, I stopped taking them (I involuntarily went cold turkey - do not recommend). And after all that I felt good too, no major depression whatsoever, so I guess for the time being it was the right decision.

Now I am in a very very dark place again, and I have been for months, and it's become so severe that I even consider taking meds again, Venlafaxin that is.

I'm curious about the experiences others in this community might have made with Venlafaxin, what their opinion is, and one of my biggest worries: if someone experience weight gain taking Venlafaxin. 

Anyway, I appreciate any kind of insight! Thank you!",857
duloxetine vs venlafaxine: impact on cognitive brain functions,"Hello. Currently I take 150mg of venlafaxine however due to many side effects my doctor prescribed me 60mg duloxetine instead.

Effexor(venlafaxine),"Hi all, sorry if this has been posted somewhere already, I‚Äôm new to the subreddit, but I just wanted spread this warning. If you are on Effexor, generic name venlafaxine, and you are dealing with urinary incontinence, there is a strong likelihood that it‚Äôs the drug. 
It‚Äôs not a well researched or talked about side effect but more and more people are coming forward with this issue. I spent a hellish year, wasting money on doctors, trying to figure out what was causing me to suddenly be unable to hold my urine, because both my psychiatrist and pharmacist said it couldn‚Äôt be the medication; except that it absolutely was and as soon as I came off of it I could go out in public again with only my agoraphobia to fear and not the possibility that I might literally piss myself.

venlafaxine (effexor) still visual problems after 2 years of discontinuing,"title says it all. got off of it 2 years+ ago. still have visual problems in short distance like 15cm approx from my eyes i cant see properly. yes, it definitely was not there when i first got on venlafaxine. i noticed my close vision got worse a few days into the treatment. went to eye doctor. he confirmed it causes visual problems but obviously he could not help me at all beyond that.  
didnt see a doctor for it tbh bc my guess is they wont be able to do anything anyways. anyone got this fixed somehow?  
seen numerous other ppl complaining abt it online.  
none of those stupid doctors tells you anything about something like that before treatment and prescription leaflet does neither.",863
Venlafaxine Withdrawal,I'm quitting venlafaxine after 1.5 years and I'm scared.,864
Withdrawal from venlafaxine/Effexor,"I started going off Effexor around 3 to 4 weeks ago my original those was 225 that I have been on for years. I first went from 225 to 183, and a week later from 183 to 150, after being on 150 MG for 2 to 3 weeks I just jumped from 150 to 100 with advice from my psychiatrist. It‚Äôs been since this past Friday and I have been having all kinds of crazy side effects, the worst for me is the dizziness, I feel dizzy/lightheaded all day, and that triggers anxiety for me. Does anybody have any tips on how to control the dizziness, considering that I work five days a week around 10 hours a day. Any tips or tricks would really help.",865
Post Venlafaxine/Effexor Feelings,"Hello everyone! 

I am a long-time sufferer of depression and I am currently on medication for it and have been for a few years. 

I am taking 150mg Bupropion xl and 75mg of Venlafaxine ER.  I started the Venlafaxine about two years ago and worked my way up to 225mg. About six months ago, I decided I wanted to taper off the Venlafaxine. I didn't like the side effects, the withdrawal it caused if I was even an hour late taking it, and I just feel like it dampened too many of my emotions (especially the good ones). 

With my doctor's blessing, I SLOWLY began tapering off and I'm about to start  37.5mg, the smallest and last dosage before completely tapering off. I have experienced the withdrawals and the sickness that comes with that in the past and expect to encounter those again until the medication is out of my system.

However, I would like to hear if any of you have success stories on feeling ""yourself"" again after quitting Venlafaxine. 

Right now, one of my most missed emotions/feelings is excitement. I used to get excited about little things like going to the movies, seeing friends, going on trips, etc... On Venlafaxine, I didn't really have that. I didn't even get excited about my first trip to Disney World! That's not to say I wasn't happy when I got there but leading up to it, nothing. I miss that and hope I can return to that state of mind.

Any similar experiences?",866
Excessive sweating Effexor vs pristiq,"I am currently on the highest dose of Effexor  225 mg. I sweat like a freaking pig to the point that my clothes are soaked as if I took a shower in them. My doctor suggested that I switch to Pristiq to see if that helps however, I am reading that sweating is a side effect of it as well. Has anyone else been on Effexor  and had the excessive sweating and successfully switched to Pristiq and it helped with that?",867
Started Effexor,"Zoloft didn‚Äôt work for me, so now I‚Äôm on Effexor. How do I know if it‚Äôs actually working? Am I just in a good mood sometimes or is it the Placebo effect? Am I still depressed or am I just sad because of my break up?",868

I usually would get to work around 4:30 and work til 3 no issue and I‚Äôve been getting there at like 8 and barely making it past noon without feeling like I‚Äôm gonna give out.

"Kratom, effexor, depression and phenylpiracetam.","Hi there ! I'm coming to ask for advices, if there would be any. I've been suffering from a burnout with moderate depression since months. Due to exhaustion, instabily and emotional surges.
I've been on 4 different types of ssri before, none really worked for my anxiety, maybe a little bit for mood.
So since a few weeks, my doc upgraded me on effexor (venlaxafine), an snri.
This stuff has improved my mood and reduced my anxiety more than all the ssri I've tried. But I still have a problem : very low motivation, energy and almost constant lethargy. Kratom has been a godsend for keeping me off alcohol and drugs, been using daily since 2,5 years. Never had a single relapse since then. Took a good care of my anxiety and mood also. I intend to quit daily use as soon as ill be back to a somewhat baseline of mental health.
As I'm very interested in nootropics and cognitive enhancers, studying them before ordering and trying a few, phenylpiracetam is now the God send. It's the only thing that gets me rid of all depression and low energy symptoms while making me productive, because I can't lie in bed all day, got things to do ! But it's not intended for daily use as tolerance increases rapidly. 
So I think that my problem is dopamine related, phenylpiracetam being a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. So I was about to ask my doc for a script of wellbutrin (bupropion) which also acts as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Unfortunately I read yesterday that it's a bad idea to mix this one with kratom, many people report seizures. Modafinil has the same consequences along kratom.
So maybe any of you might have an idea of a med that could take care of dopamine?
Thanks for reading me.",870
Effexor and anger?,"A few weeks ago I switched to effexor. Over all its been great, more energy, less anxiety, depression manageable. However I have also noticed a huge increase in anger. I am short tempered, everyone irritates me, feel pissed off all day and night.

Venlafaxine(Effexor) is the devil,"
TL:DR
 I‚Äôm going cold turkey on this because it ruins my life

Hello guys üëãüèª
I‚Äôm diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression and was put on Venlafaxine a lil bit more than half a year ago. Little to say it numbed all my emotions it also numbed my sexual drive, sexual functioning and libido to non existent. As a person with extremely high sexual drive I felt even better at first. First time in my life my horniness doesn‚Äôt control me and my mind. In the emotion aspect I didn‚Äôt feel really a significant change, that‚Äôs when I told my doctor I think we should try something else. Instead she increased the dose and I was put on 225mg. I met a very nice girl recently (around 1.5 months ago) and we started dating very seriously. We felt very emotionally connected - same interests, hobbies, etc. We have met almost every other day. First time in my life I felt so connected to a human being. When it came to bed she said she doesn‚Äôt feel any sexual chemistry between us - oh boy she was right, I couldn‚Äôt feel anything - let alone ejaculate or to even maintain an erection. I decided to go cold turkey on this devil med a few days ago and I‚Äôm already starting to feel better sexually. Today the girl decided to end our relationship because as I said she thinks we are not sexually compatible. And I feel like I potentially lost the love of my life thanks to a stupid med.
I opened up to her about this problem a few days ago but I don‚Äôt think she realised to what extent my sexual drive was off. It was literally in shambles.
I don‚Äôt know what to do now, no way I‚Äôm taking this med ever again, I don‚Äôt recommend it to my worst enemy‚Ä¶

Effexor,"Hi! I was put on Effexor a month ago, first week at 75mg, and then 150mg for last three weeks. My previous medication stopped working after 15 years. However, I am still having suicidal thoughts. Do I need to give this more time, or should I be considering a switch of medication? There has been an improvement in my condition, I am functional again (doctor has also prescribed clonazepam) however I am concerned about the continuing suicidal thoughts and low mood. Any advice from those who have taken Effexor is appreciated! Thanks",873
Is it normal for Venlafaxine (Effexor XR) to increase depression initially?,"I've been taking Venlafaxine (Effexor XR) for 11 days now, at a dosage of 75 mg a day. Instead of feeling better, I've noticed that my depression seems to have gotten worse. Is this a normal side effect in the beginning? Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice or similar experiences would be appreciated.",874
Wellbutrin or venlafaxin/ effexor for depression? ,"I have depression and struggle to have any motivation to do the things that I used to do before.

I also have adhd.

My doctor put me on wellbutrin 100 mg xr. I was feeling okay on it, but anxious and more scattered with my adhd. Wellbutrin has helped me wake up in the morning and I fall asleep better than before, but I feel different in my head, like sometimes I have a head high. 

My doctor suggested I double my dose and see how I feel in terms of my concentration, because I was feeling more scattered than normal on the 100 mg. I did that today and took 200mg and felt better/ more concentrated during the day, but super emotional at night and I was agitated throughout the day. 

I am wondering if wellbutrin just isn‚Äôt for me and have been reading about effexor as an alternative to wellbutrin. 

Has anyone had experience with both drugs who can comment on what‚Äôs the best course of action? 

Thank you",875

Advice for Effexor Withdrawals?,"Hiiiii everyone! 

A lot of the advice I've seen on effexor withdrawals have come from people who are actively trying to stop taking it. There's been many issues with my prescription and my pharmacy(s) that I've suddenly been without it cold turkey been for 5 days and I cannot recall having such a bad combo of physical and mental unwellness. 

I've been on 112.5mg for about a year now and it doesn't seem like I'm going to get any answers from my doctor or pharmacy until Monday. I've missed two going on three days of work and I'm unable to function as I normally would. Any tips or advice or just general well wishes would be so appreciated!!",877
Major depression- TMS - Effexor,"Hello, I have been in major depression for a month and a half.

Quitting Effexor,"The withdrawal symptoms now that I‚Äôm quitting Effexor are pretty intense. Extreme anxiety, headaches, nausea, dizziness, brain zaps. I know all of these symptoms are common BUT did anyone else experience increased blood pressure?!",879
Effexor - quick effect or placebo?,"I started taking Effexor/Venlafaxine yesterday and basically started experiencing effects within 3 hours. Nausia is an obvious one but I also felt a significant change in mood (positive). I was told typically it takes quite a bit of time for it to have an impact, but people often get an early jolt of extra energy (which I certainly experienced, but I also experienced mood adjustment).

My question is, have other people had similar quick effects or am I just experiencing a Placebo effect?",880
Cant tell if depression is from Effexor or life ,"Over a month ago my gf and I split and we were very in love we shared an aparmtnet with two animals. The next day I was in a bad accident and totaled my car. My car was older so I got around 4k for it and just dropped 11k on a new car. I was feeling mentally out of it all month. I‚Äôm not the type to wear my emotions on my sleeve I‚Äôm bad at expressing it but people at work noticed. They asked if I was okay many times . My mentor (I‚Äôm an apprentice at a body shop) noticed my mental decline. I no longer want to work. I don‚Äôt care as much. I was still functioning after my mental hospital visit which was 3 days after the wreck and breakup. My ex is improving her life and herself smoothly and I am not. This week has been the worst. Week 6 on Effexor and I can‚Äôt stop crying all day long. I‚Äôm in so much pain. I miss my girlfriend I miss my dog and my cat I miss my home. I feel so lost and broken. I‚Äôve been through sooo much to be so young and I don‚Äôt know what to do. My ex doesn‚Äôt want to see me and has blocked me out for good for her own well being and I just miss my home and my family . It‚Äôs not fair, I can‚Äôt grow good living with my recovered addict of a dad. He‚Äôs cool and all but I‚Äôm not doing so well. 
The past week my room has been digusting. I cannot stand to be awake. I‚Äôve never felt this low before and I struggle from bipolar MDD anxiery etc. so I‚Äôm used to be depressed but this is something different . I come home from work take a nap wake up eat dinner , slam an ambien or two , sleep, ambien wakes me up at 4 am on the dot so I get up and go into the shop and work alone. My name is on the lease of the apartment but I already committed to going to my dads and she‚Äôs doing so well I can‚Äôt just come in and demand shit because she‚Äôs a bit of a narcissist and hard to reason with so it‚Äôll just go up in flames and I won‚Äôt win. Cant afford to live there alone if she left anyways after just dropping my whole savings on a car. I was so numb the last few weeks until now and I don‚Äôt know how much more I can take ",881
More venlafaxine (Effexor) or less?,"I‚Äôve been on Effexor ER for about 10 weeks now (first 37.5mg, then 75mg).

It‚Äôs making me feel much happier, reducing anxiety and depression, but I‚Äôm increasingly unable to focus on or even take an interest in doing anything (much more than before starting it). I‚Äôm just ok doing nothing. 

Is this an indication that the drug is not the right one and i need try another, or that I‚Äôm experiencing a partial response and need to increase the dosage? 

Curious how I should expect my doctor to react when I see him next.",882
Is cross-tapering from Pristiq to something else easier than Effexor to something else?,"I was once one Effexor and had a horrific time cross-tapering from Effexor back to Lexapro or some other SSRI.  Some genius psychiatrist has had me on Pristiq for the past four months and I hate it, and I'm going cross-taper to something else.

For any who have done it, is cross-tapering from Pristiq to something else easier than cross tapering form Effexor to something else (not another SNRI, never fucking again).

  
It's worth mentioning that my panic disorder w/agoraphobia is way worse than my depression these days.  My MDD was once much worse, but it has gotten significantly better over the years with lots of therapy.  ",883
Effexor alternatives?,"I was on Effexor for about 4 years - not a huge dose, 112.5mg if I remember correctly. When I came off of it, my therapist asked me what my experience of coming off of it was like. I told her that it was really easy, and that I'd never had problems even if I missed a dose here and there - no ""brain zaps"" or shifts in mood. That led her to wonder if the Effexor had ever really been working that well for me in the first place.

That was about 18 months ago. I'm fighting with depression again as of late and she's suggested that I talk to my M.D. about getting back onto meds. Effexor is an option, but is there something else I can look at that may be more effective? My main side effect while on Effexor was an impact on my sexual performance - avoiding that would be great if possible!",884
I‚Äôm finally off Effexor,"I‚Äôm finally off Effexor and I feel so much better. On effexor I was bedridden with these pounding daily migraines (the worst feeling I‚Äôve ever felt in my life), standing up and bending down made me dizzy, I was constantly nauseous, I had pain all over my body, I was living in a blur. I had a full on mental breakdown. I didn‚Äôt know it was effexor at first. And I wasn‚Äôt really depressed but that‚Äôs cos I was so anxious and scared about how sick I was. If I didn‚Äôt take my Effexor within the same hour every day I would feel even worse. This is what made me decide to come off of it. It took me a year to slowly ween off Effexor but now I‚Äôm finally off. I know they work so well for so many people. I just don‚Äôt know how this one med could have caused me all that sickness lol‚Ä¶ how did it even do that?????",885
high-dose effexor + lyrica withdrawals,"it is week four since I was forced to go cold turkey off of 1050mg Effexor and 3600mg Lyrica (I was stupid to have gone this high in the first place, but it worked very well as long as it did..). taking sertraline for withdrawals, and while it gets me rid of the brain zaps for a day, it causes extreme anxiety and high resting bp (200/120, hr 120), so it's pretty traumatic in and of itself.

I can only manage to fall asleep after 20h of being awake, antihistamines/opiates/weed make the nausea unbearable so they're of no help. also, as far as these aforementioned drugs go, I was a long-time 'recreational' user of benzos, opiates, downers and stims of all kinds. i don't know what it is about this specific combo (lyrica + effexr) or if it was just the dose, but it was HELL compared to e.g. oxy and adderall withdrawals.  
on the plus side, most of the mental symptoms appear to be subsiding with a somewhat better 'mental' outcome compared to when I was taking the drugs (I'm less suicidal, can enjoy more things, funny enough music sounds better). that said, the constant vertigo, nausea, vomiting and general dizzinness are just murdering me.

&#x200B;

for anyone in a similar situation PLEASE consider tapering, like you're supposed to. and in retrospect, if I could go back in time I'd never have exceeded 75mgs Effexor and would never start taking Lyrica. I'm pretty convinced I also wouldn't have started taking Lyricas regularly, hadn't it been for the extreme physical turmoil a gram of Venlafaxine was putting me through on the daily.

Effexor withdrawal help,"After over a year on effexor, I've gotten to a place where I've felt better and have decided to discontinue use of the medication. I was working with a psychiatrist who helped me taper the dose down to the lowest possible dose, but the last time I met with them, the best they could do beyond that was say that I just needed to find a time when I could handle the withdrawal. I'm on summer break from grad school and haven't started my summer job yet, and missed a dose on Thursday and decided it's now or never. Tomorrow (sunday) will be day 4 without it and I'm glad to be finally free from it, but the withdrawal symptoms are terrible. The head zaps aren't as frequent now, but it basically feels like I have the flu and I keep seeing online that sometimes the physical symptoms can last for 5 days and sometimes it can last for a month. Is there anything that helps with the withdrawal? I'm going to pick up imodium tomorrow and Tylenol has been helping with the headache. I guess I could also use some cheering on because I've been tackling this alone (at least until my next therapy session).",888
Effexor Insomnia & Sexual Drive.. There‚Äôs Hope,"Hello everyone. I‚Äôm a 24M and I was diagnosed with MDD and GAD a year ago. This was when I was diagnosed, however, I‚Äôve been having these episodes for more than 6 years. When I decided to see a psychiatrist for the first time in my life which was a year ago, he put me on fluoxetine. It was great, it made my life totally different and everyone started to notice that. I was so happy with it and kinda hypomanic. The only side effect which I really hated was the insomnia. Decreased libido? Yeah but I actually didn‚Äôt care that much. I sleep easier with fluoxetine but I can never maintain my sleep and I wake up several times a night. And when I wake up sometimes it‚Äôs impossible to get back to sleep. Add to that that the maximum hours I can sleep is 4-5 hours. This was so frustrating for me because when I decieded to start on an antidepressant I also decided to go to the gym, for the first time in my life. Why? Because I know that working out is preventive also the endorphins are real. There was never a time when I ended my exercise and never felt great and happy, doesn‚Äôt matter how shit I felt before that. So what‚Äôs the problem? The problem is that if you go to the gym and do resistance exercise and you don‚Äôt have high quality and good ammount of sleep, your muscle gains will lack. I used to exercise every single day for 1.5 hours but by the end of the month I only gain 200-300g of muscle. Even sometime, I lose muscle insated of gaining any, so frustrating. I was started with 20mg up to 40mg then up to 60mg. 60mg was where I felt the best. Sadly, two months on 60mg I started to relapse, and the depressive symptoms started to come again and I didn‚Äôt have the energy to do anything and my mood significantly lowered (prozac poop-out). I told my psychiatrist so he put me on 80mg, but I was never back to where I was before. So after 9 months on being with fluoxetine, my psychiatrist decided to put me on Venlafaxine (Effexor) XR. 

I was started on 75mg and I kept taking it for a month. I actually felt really bad at first with high anxiety and sucidal thoughts, which my psychiatrist warned me about at first. A month of taking it I had an incident with a friend which made me feeling really sucidial and I was really about to kill myslef someway. However I survived that and my psychatrist adviced me to up the dose to 150mg. I was really scared of what people said about venlafaxine withdrawals and how it is the worst of any antidepressant. In addition, I used to believe that it wasn‚Äôt doing any good for me. So I decided to stop the medication cold turky. How were the withdrawals? actually they weren‚Äôt that bad. The most bothersome was the brain-zaps. However, remember that I just took it for 2 months. I told my psychatrist in the next appointment that I stopped taking the medication a month ago and now I feel really amazing and you don‚Äôt have to worry about me ‚Äòcause now I feel the best, also now I workout so you don‚Äôt have to worry since now my lifestyle has changed.

1 day after stopping venlafaxine the first thing I noticed was the sexual drive. I felt like my libido was hitting really strong. A few weeks passed then I started to sleep better than being on fluoxetine and venlafaxine. I remember telling myself: I will never take those poisons anymore, whatever happens. Then a month passed since my last dose. Guess what? ‚ÄúHere comes Johnny!‚Äù Yes, depression and anxiety came back again and stronger than ever. I talked to my psychiatrist and told him please save me, I‚Äôm really dying. This was the worst. I was started on venlafaxine XR 75mg again. Then after 2 weeks up to 150mg. Now I have to say that after having a relapse and using the drug for 1 month, the drug is making a difference! A really big one. However, insomnia and to some degree decreased libido were really annoying.

After 3 months of being on the medication, something started to really change. My sleep! like suddenly now I find myself sleep better and deeper! I mean yes the vivid dreams were there but when I sleep I can really tell that I slept deeper. Also, now when I suddenly wake up in the night I find it really easy to get back to sleep, like in a minute. I started to be able to sleep up to 8 even 9 hours a day! I don‚Äôt say that I never wake up, I do wake up but now I wake up way less, sometimes only once or twice. I was really happy because for me now better sleep quality and quanity = more muscle gains. And It actually was. I swear that just a month of good sleep everyone around me started to tell me ‚ÄúYou really started to gain muscle!‚Äù Like every single day. Also the InBody readings were way better than any month in the previous year. I used to gain 400g of muscle a month max. Now after the insomnia almost went away I gained 1300g of muscle. This is really big! I believe this can also be better by exercising harder and eating more. 

So anything in addition to sleep? Yes, my libido. God, I really can tell that my libido has come back and better than ever. I just can‚Äôt handle it sometimes. I‚Äôm not married to tell you what my spouse is telling about that but I really feel it stronger than ever.

So, that was my story with depression and specifically drugs insomnia. I decided to make this account just to give you all hope. I used to visit reddit frequently to read about depression and the insomnia associated with antidepressants use. This really helped me to get accustomed to my depression and anxiety and feel like I‚Äôm not alone here. There are millions who feel the same I do. So here I wrote my story to give you all hope.",889
EFFEXOR WITHDRAWAL,"
Hello, thank you for accepting me.
So, Ive been tappering of Efexor 150mg for about 1month now.
I was taking 75mg in the morning and 75mg in the evening, ext. Release version. Ive been on it for 9 months. 
My doctor recommended me to tapper of 1/4 of a dose every 4 days, so Id be off in less then a month. Since that felt completely insane to me, i started way more slow.
Im tappering by taking out the bids in the capsule, each capsule has 300 bids (so 600 in a day), and ive been taking 10 out from each capsule (so 290 and 290, and then 280 and 280, and then 270 and 270, ...etc) and staying on one dose for 7 days. So basically, 20 beads in 7 days. This is around 5% decrease a week. 
Ive been feeling like LIVING hell.
First week or so was okay, and then it has gotten worse and worse every day. I feel like im having constant, severe flu, body aches and pains, brain feels like its boiling every day, tension headaches, im tired 24/7 no matter how much I sleep. I sweat NON STOP and i feel feverish all the time. I also have vertigo, dizziness and weird brain feelings (had those before effexor too), but they are MUCH worse now. Ive tested for covid, since it feels like being extremely ill, always negative. Ive also had mood swings, pretty much every day. 

Can those things i feel still be from effexor, even if im going so slow?
If so, what can i do to help myself? I want to be off of this shit rather sooner than later but, should i go even slower? Is there anything that helps? Or this maybe isnt even withdrawal and its something else? 

Thank you so much.",890

I was started on 75mg and I kept taking it for a month. I actually felt really bad at first with high anxiety and sucidal thoughts, which my psychiatrist warned me about at first. A month of taking it I had an incident with a friend which made me feeling really sucidial and I was really about to kill myslef someway. However I survived that and my psychatrist adviced me to up the dose to 150mg. I was really scared of what people said about venlafaxine withdrawals and how it is the worst of any antidepressant. In addition, I used to believe that it wasn‚Äôt doing any good for me. So I decided to stop the medication cold turky. How were the withdrawals? actually they weren‚Äôt that bad. The most bothersome was the brain-zaps. However, remember that I just took it for 2 months. I told my psychatrist in the next appointment that I stopped taking the medication a month ago and now I feel really amazing and you don‚Äôt have to worry about me ‚Äòcause now I feel the best, also now I workout so you don‚Äôt have to worry since now my lifestyle has changed.

1 day after stopping venlafaxine the first thing I noticed was the sexual drive. I felt like my libido was hitting really strong. A few weeks passed then I started to sleep better than being on fluoxetine and venlafaxine. I remember telling myself: I will never take those poisons anymore, whatever happens. Then a month passed since my last dose. Guess what? ‚ÄúHere comes Johnny!‚Äù Yes, depression and anxiety came back again and stronger than ever. I talked to my psychiatrist and told him please save me, I‚Äôm really dying. This was the worst. I was started on venlafaxine XR 75mg again. Then after 2 weeks up to 150mg. Now I have to say that after having a relapse and using the drug for 1 month, the drug is making a difference! A really big one. However, insomnia and to some degree decreased libido were really annoying.

After 3 months of being on the medication, something started to really change. My sleep! like suddenly now I find myself sleep better and deeper! I mean yes the vivid dreams were there but when I sleep I can really tell that I slept deeper. Also, now when I suddenly wake up in the night I find it really easy to get back to sleep, like in a minute. I started to be able to sleep up to 8 even 9 hours a day! I don‚Äôt say that I never wake up, I do wake up but now I wake up way less, sometimes only once or twice. I was really happy because for me now better sleep quality and quanity = more muscle gains. And It actually was. I swear that just a month of good sleep everyone around me started to tell me ‚ÄúYou really started to gain muscle!‚Äù Like every single day. Also the InBody readings were way better than any month in the previous year. I used to gain 400g of muscle a month max. Now after the insomnia almost went away I gained 1300g of muscle. This is really big! I believe this can also be better by exercising harder and eating more. 

So anything in addition to sleep? Yes, my libido. God, I really can tell that my libido has come back and better than ever. I just can‚Äôt handle it sometimes. I‚Äôm not married to tell you what my spouse is telling about that but I really feel it stronger than ever.

So, that was my story with depression and specifically drugs insomnia. I decided to make this account just to give you all hope. I used to visit reddit frequently to read about depression and the insomnia associated with antidepressants use. This really helped me to get accustomed to my depression and anxiety and feel like I‚Äôm not alone here. There are millions who feel the same I do. So here I wrote my story to give you all hope.",892
"Accidentally missed Effexor dose, horrible symptoms","So I‚Äôve been on Effexor for about a year now and I just recently got upped to around 200mg. I‚Äôve missed doses and have had bad withdrawals before, but now that my intake is so much higher than before the withdrawals are hell. 

This quite literally feels like withdrawal from hard substances, to the point where I haven‚Äôt been able to move for 3 hours. I‚Äôve been shaking, I‚Äôm so dizzy I can barely see, and so nauseous I cannot stand. The vertigo is insane. 

I took my dose about 2 hours later than usual, and 2 hours have passed since and the symptoms have not lessened. 

Are there any ways I can calm them down so I can actually do productive things today? Please let me know in the comments",893
Effexor(venlafaxine),"Hi all, sorry if this has been posted somewhere already, I‚Äôm new to the subreddit, but I just wanted spread this warning. If you are on Effexor, generic name venlafaxine, and you are dealing with urinary incontinence, there is a strong likelihood that it‚Äôs the drug. 
It‚Äôs not a well researched or talked about side effect but more and more people are coming forward with this issue. I spent a hellish year, wasting money on doctors, trying to figure out what was causing me to suddenly be unable to hold my urine, because both my psychiatrist and pharmacist said it couldn‚Äôt be the medication; except that it absolutely was and as soon as I came off of it I could go out in public again with only my agoraphobia to fear and not the possibility that I might literally piss myself.

Bupropion for Effexor drowsiness,"Hello,
To make it short, I‚Äôm a mid 20 guy who has been depressed for a very long time. Probably around 10 years. I‚Äôve started taking SSRI‚Äôs at 20 yo. Tried sertraline, sitalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine. None of them worked. But I‚Äôve experienced side effects, like difficulty getting up in the morning and less alert than usual.


Recently, I‚Äôve been on Effexor 75mg for 2 weeks, which worked great until around the 10th day. I‚Äôve been augmented to 150 mg, which is working well. But the problem is that I feel drowsy, not alert, fatigued, sleepy and foggy. 
Have somebody experienced that? Have you been prescribed something to counter that off ? 


I thought of bupropion which have a stimulant effect, but still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the usual solution to that.

Withdrawal from venlafaxine/Effexor,"I started going off Effexor around 3 to 4 weeks ago my original those was 225 that I have been on for years. I first went from 225 to 183, and a week later from 183 to 150, after being on 150 MG for 2 to 3 weeks I just jumped from 150 to 100 with advice from my psychiatrist. It‚Äôs been since this past Friday and I have been having all kinds of crazy side effects, the worst for me is the dizziness, I feel dizzy/lightheaded all day, and that triggers anxiety for me. Does anybody have any tips on how to control the dizziness, considering that I work five days a week around 10 hours a day. Any tips or tricks would really help.",896
Tapering off Trazodone ,I‚Äôve been on Trazodone 25mg (lowest dose I think) for 9 months. I wanna stop taking it but I know my psychiatrist won‚Äôt allow me (she wants me to switch to other meds but I‚Äôm scared of the side effects). I feel like Trazodone is making me feel numb and stupid the whole time. Any advice on how to stop taking it? ,897
Something better than trazodone,"O I guess I‚Äôm looking for something that‚Äôs better than that because the other one was starting to really screw with my head I almost had myself committed because of how bad it got, but I‚Äôm off at now, so meet something better that doesn‚Äôt screw with my head as much",898
Trazodone causing mood swings?,So i've been on trazodone for a little more than a week now and was prescribed it to help me sleep and also for my depression. I take 150mg right now & so far though i've been having weird mood swings while on it mostly not caused by any triggers. I just switch from feeling really good suddenly and finally having some motivation to plan my future and do stuff and then I suddenly just crash for no reason and am insanely suicidal and depressed. It switches quite fast sometimes im fine for a day then boom i feel like shit and other times it switches within the day. I do have to say trazodone also makes me very jittery and anxious. I know that can just be a side effect for now the mood swings are kinda annoying though so... idk if it's only me experiencing that?,899
Switch form Zoloft to Trazodone,"Hey! I was on Zoloft 100mg for 10 years and recently my GP put me on Trazodone 100mg as I was having a rough time and the Zoloft seemed to not work anymore. However since the switch (5 days) I am experiencing lots of awful brain zaps....   
is it possible that the Trazodone dose is too low??   
Moreover, I read that Trazodone is a sedative, the problem is that I am already really tired during the day. An increase of Trazodone would only worsen this....   
What would you lovely people recommend? thanks!!",900
meds - trazodone and lexapro,"hi! this is kinda just to vent.. ive been taking lexapro for over a month now and its been rlly good for me, increased mood and i feel like i can be myself again. the problem was still my inability to sleep. i would fall asleep fine but wake up at least twice a night and have troubles falling asleep. i was living on 3h of sleep still. so my psychiatrist prescribed trazodone 50mg. one pill is 150 so i have to take 1/3 every night. 
and its worked beautifully the past two days(somewhat!). i sleep a full 8-9h without interruptions, like a fucken baby. but i have trouble waking up for school. when i wasnt taking trazodone i could get out of bed easy and manage to feel somewhat awake. but now its like im a zombie almost all day. in the morning and after school especially. im wondering if the side effects will go away. i now have trouble with libido, but that started with lexapro and i forgot to mention it the last time i saw her. sex life is plummeting and its kind of annoying. and i dont like that trazodone is making me SO fucking sleepy. like i cant. i havent been to the gym and it feels like im more depressed because of the fatigue, and too tired to do stuff i love so happiness is limited. IDK",901
Prozac and Trazodone,"Hello everyone, I recently saw a psychiatrist for the first time in my life, got diagnosed and was prescribed prozac (20mg, once every morning) and trazodone(75 mg)-this one only to take as needed to help with sleep. For the past year and a half I have had huge difficulties falling asleep and no matter how much sleep I would end up getting (usually not a lot, probably like 4 hours a night, but sometimes I would get the healthy 8 hours) I would always feel tired after waking up. My doctor also said to start with 1/3 of a Trazodone pill when I feel like I need it and see what the effect is and adjust it according to my needs up to 1 pill. 

I‚Äôve read that SSRIs and Trazodone don‚Äôt go all that well together and that the combination can increase the risk of developing serotonin syndrome.

Has anyone been prescribed these two at the same time? What were your experiences, did you have any side effects? Thank you in advance and sorry for possible English mistakes, it‚Äôs not my first language.",902
Trazodone Sexual Side Effects,"I've been taking Wellbutrin for a year and 3 weeks ago my doctor started me on 50mg of Trazodone to help with my depression, anxiety and insomnia. I was under the impression that Trazodone doesn't have sexual side effects, but I haven't been able to ejaculate for 2 weeks. 

The Trazodone is definitely working. It helps with my depression and anxiety, and I can now fall asleep in 10 minutes. 

QUESTION:

I'm wondering if anyone taking Trazodone experienced an inability to ejaculate. If yes, did it subside overtime? 

Also, does anyone know of any meds or tricks to help with this side effect?",903
Celexa (citalopram) + Trazodone,"I have been taking this combo for  20 yrs. I take Celexa 20 mg around lunch time and Trazodone 50 mg before bed. When I started taking the combo, at 29 it was my first exposure to a psychoactive substance (never did any legal or illegal drugs or psychoactive substances before that) . Celexa helped to feel good ( first few weeks were like a Xmas morning everyday) and helped me gain confidence at work. 20 yrs later I am self-sufficient financially and modestly successful, probably due to the two drugs. 

But now they don't do much. After I lost my support system during COVID, and as some family members passed away, the dark clouds have gathered overhead again. I see no future or have any hope left. But I still need to function to survive and pay my bills. I have been planning to end my life after Mom passes away, but not sure I will go through with it unless I can find a surefire painless way to do it. That is probably a couple of years away.

Meanwhile, I am wondering if there is any other drug combo that might help restore some hope. Please share if a certain drug combo that worked for you after Celexa + Trazodone. Thanks.",904
Trazodone help,"So, awhile back, my doctor prescribed 50mg trazodone for sleep, which gave me the most amazing sleep I‚Äôve experienced.  Sadly, after about 2 weeks, I discontinued due to bad headaches.  I have not since found a pill that gives me a more steady, solid, achievable sleep.  We have tried mirtazapine (which made me dream all night, as well as rapidly gain weight).   We tried doxepin, which knocked me on my butt during the day.  (25mg, reduced to 10mg) and I never felt well rested.  I‚Äôve picked back up my bottle of trazodone and am again experiencing good sleep (and much less anxiety the day after!) but I know the headaches are just around the corner.  Oddly, they aren‚Äôt until about 22-23 hours after my dose (a few hours before my next bed time).  What could be causing this?  I hate discontinuing a pill that‚Äôs working so well.  Aspirin, tylenol, and ibuprofen won‚Äôt touch the headache.  .50mg of Xanax and it‚Äôs gone in five minutes.",905
Trazodone added to Prozac,"I have been on 10mg of Prozac for 3 months and feel great but I have a hard time sleeping. My dr prescribed 50mg of trazodone as needed. I‚Äôm not wanting to be on two meds regularly but if it could help with sleep then I‚Äôm open to try.

"Trazodone: I have insomnia, and I'm very anxious and depressed.","Hello, I have been on welbutrin and vyvanse for a while now, and I feel like the welbutrin has increased my anxiety levels through the roof.

I know most people would think that it's the vyvanse, but I was taking vyvanse before i started welbutrin, and the vyvanse calmed me down. 

I had a telehealth with my psych yesterday, and I asked her about trazodone, mirtazapine, and seroquel, for treating my depression, anxiety, and my insomnia, since the past few months my sleep has been rapidly declining. I told her that I think its the welbutrin causing all the negative side affects, and i asked if i could wean off of it and start a new medication. We both decided on 50mg Trazodone, weaning off the welbutrin and staying on the trazodone.

I have since read that trazodone has a short half life, and many have to take it (i.e 3 times a day), or that they had to take it along side another antidepressant. I was just wondering if anyone has had any experience taking trazodone by itself? or if you had to supplement it with another antidepressant?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Started trazodone, to replace welbutrin, I read that trazodone is usually supplemented with another antidepressant, and I'm unsure of what to do.

Bupropion generic options,"I'm looking for the best generic manufacturer of bupropion because name brand is dummy expensive. I've been using the one from Par Pharmaceuticals for years but they discontinued production of all their bupropion products Dec 2023.

Actavis is garbage. Symptoms below. 

I'm currently on the one from Lupin. It had the same casing so I was hoping it would work the same. It absolutely does not and feels the same as actavis.

Having an allergic reaction to Bupropion XL‚Ä¶ where do I go now?,"I (23F) have been on and off SSRIs since I was about 13, specifically Lexapro, Celexa, and Prozac, all in varying doses and for various lengths of time, some of which exceeded a year. None of them seemed to do much and I‚Äôd find myself dealing with SSRI induced apathy, weight gain, and other unpleasant but manageable side effects as a result of taking them. Overall, I just couldn‚Äôt say they made me feel better, so after my second attempt of taking Celexa and close to a year of battling depression unmedicated, I decided I‚Äôd give Wellbutrin a try. The past three weeks of being on 150mg of it have been fantastic and life changing to say the least‚Ä¶ I could enjoy everything again, sleep well and wake up feeling rested, I had the energy and motivation to be active and accomplish goals, and most importantly, I felt normal- it was pure bliss. Wellbutrin has been everything I could ever ask for in an antidepressant, but today after a visit with my doctor and two days of hives, I can no longer take it. I‚Äôm fucking devastated and I hate myself for ever starting it to begin with because getting a taste of what my life could be like only for it to be ripped away hurts so much worse than not knowing what being normal feels like. I‚Äôm currently having to take steroids and antihistamines to combat the allergic reaction and flush the meds from my system, I have no clue where to go from here, and this experience is sending me into a downward spiral. All of this feels like a cruel joke and I‚Äôm really struggling with all of it. Does anyone have any suggestions? Are there any antidepressants I can try that would give me at least similar results? Will any of this ever get better?",911
Wellbutrin / bupropion - FDA: Teva/Actavis generics are not effective,"In 2011-2012 the FDA received so many complaints about Teva brand bupropion 300mg that they launched an investigation, found it isn't bioequivalent to name brand Wellbutrin, and pulled it off the market - but only the 300mg dose! Teva is still allowed to sell their lower dose versions of the same thing. Teva acquired Actavis, so Actavis is the same too. 150mg Teva is labeled ""A 101"", Actavis is ""WPI 3331"". Lower doses and non-extended-release versions will have different labels.

When my pharmacy gives me either of these generic brands, within a few days my mood absolutely plummets down to hell. **I fall asleep feeling desperately hopeless, and that same desperate hopelessness is looming heavy over me, oppressing when I wake, before I even open my eyes.** This doesn't happen with a better brand.

[Science.org: The Generic Wellbutrin Problem](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/generic-wellbutrin-problem-whose-fault-it)

Bupropion/ Wellbutrin brain fog,Hi I was wondering if someone could tell me about their experience with bupropion and brain fog. I started taking the medication a year ago and about 6 months ago increased my dose from 150mg to 300mg. The summer was great and I felt happy and motivated for the first time in years. Keep in mind I was working out alot which made me feel good and I was working a lawn maintenance job so I was getting alot of Sun and staying active. Basically what I‚Äôm trying to get at is that life felt good and my anxiety and depression seemed to truly be gone over my summer break from university. Since starting school again I have noticed that I feel very numb like my emotions are dull and I‚Äôm out of touch with them. I also noticed that I think I am having an insane amount of brain fog. I can‚Äôt think very clearly and I am a computer science major so I have to do alot of problem solving and thinking. I noticed that I can barely think about ways to problem solve or get my code to work when last year semester (when I was on 150mg) I felt like I could think alot more clearly. I am just looking for some advice as I am worried about lowering my dose or coming off the medication because I don‚Äôt want to go back to the deep depression I was once in but I also want to feel like I can think again.

New medication bupropion aka Wellbutrin,Hi everyone ! So good be been battling my depression for well over a decade now(26m). Recently it‚Äôs gotten much worse so I finally gave in and got medicated. I suffer from depression and anxiety regularly. What‚Äôs your  experience with bupropion?,919
Why do people dislike bupropion (wellbutrin),"I have been struggling with very invasive and constant suicidal ideation for many years (I described myself as aggressively suicidal lmao). It was getting really bad recently, my psychiatrist put me on lithium + bupropion + sertraline and my suicidal thoughts have become much more manageable. It makes such an impact, that when I had a week or two without the medication I became extremely suicidal (same as I was, but I had gotten used to being less). 

Why do people dislike wellbutrin? Why are they saying to take it off the market? I'd likely die if they did that (not sure that's totally true)!",920

Apart from that, it gave me intense stomach issues which i thought would go away after the 2 week side effect mark but it's just gotten better, not gone away. I never want to try another pill again.

Quitting WelbutrinXL (bupropion),"I am an early 20‚Äôs male undergraduate student. I started taking Wellbutrin a couple months ago. Started with 150mg, went to 300 after one month. It has helped me out a ton with my depression especially regarding my energy levels and motivation to get anything done.

However, I can‚Äôt help but feel its making me less intelligent in a way. I forget so many things now. I can barely remember anything I learn in classes or from assignments. I have to incessantly check notes and PowerPoint slides for the same bits of material over and over. And its not limited to class work, I can barely remember what I do in the week or even what I did with friends just a day or two ago. For a while now I‚Äôve even been forgetting simple words in conversations. I feel I‚Äôve never had this problem before starting the medication.

Even though its making it easier for me to get up and start school work/get to class, it feels like I‚Äôm so much less efficient at getting it done that it just isn‚Äôt worth it. It‚Äôs pissing me off, and I kind of just want to stop now and live with whatever side effects come from that. As long as I don‚Äôt feel stupid.

I would talk to my doctor, but I can‚Äôt get an appointment until halfway through next month. I don‚Äôt know if I can handle another month of school like this.

Basically I have two questions:

1. If I quit it cold turkey how likely is it to mess me up even more. 

2. Is it possible to ‚Äòwean‚Äô myself off the medication by taking my 300mg dose once every other day, or is that just as bad as cold turkey.

I know quitting medications like this is a bad idea in general, but poking around the internet I have heard that bupropion is likelier to have less severe withdrawal symptoms. Any advice is appreciated.",922
Long Term Effects of Bupropion Overdose,"On December 4th it'll be four years since my overdose and I can't help but wonder if I had any brain damage from that, as I had three seizures and was unconscious for I don't know how long.

Are there any antidepressants that work like Bupropion?,"I‚Äôve been on my fair share of SSRIs and SNRIs. SSRIs have made me feel 10x worse, so did SNRIs. I didn‚Äôt give Prozac enough of a chance tbh but it kinda messed up my type 1 diabetes numbers, but idk I also didn‚Äôt know that that side effect could go away.

Wellbutrin has been the only antidepressant so far that really has helped me. I have a lot of fatigue, lots of random feelings of guilt, inability to speak mixed with tearfulness and NO motivation and I have anhendonia. I get nausea and general body weakness, hypersomnia with a hard time falling asleep. I get random bouts of being okay but they go away pretty fast.

Wellbutrin really really dehydrated me though, and it caused me to hold water weight and made me really really dizzy and awful. Anyone have similar symptoms to me and was benefited by another type of antidepressant? I also have ADHD, my ADHD meds actually made my depression 20x worse.",924

Wellbutrin,"Last May I was on TRT and had to come off due to financial reasons.

I am off the Lexapro for now because I really hated the weight gain and low libido.  I struggle everyday with unhappiness, no motivation, ruminating thoughts. am looking for anybody who has taken Wellbutrin for their depreseion and successfully was able to come out of the deep deep dark hole that is Depression and is living a full happy and healthy life now.

Wellbutrin Side Effects..,"Before I write this, I am not seeking medical advice of any kind, I'm working really well with my doctor and I know my body as well as mind. I'm going to rant more than anything here.

I'm not sure I should keep taking this medicine. The side effects are horrible for me. To be exact I'm on Sertraline 150mg and Hydroxyzine 50mg and Wellbutrin 150mg.
I don't think I should stay on it because it's causing extreme nausea to the point I can't think of food. EXTREME dry mouth. Like I can't get rid of it. My heat tolerance is even worse. I near passed out on a walk and looked stupid. Poor lady and her dog asked if I was okay and stuff and it felt embarrassing. My legs hurt and ache more than usual. My tremors and shaking is worse. I've been on it for about 5 weeks now with no days off of it.

Wellbutrin ,"I had been taking wellbutrin for probably  20 years at least. I thought I really needed it and was worried what would happen if I stopped. I really wasn't doing good but I wasn't suicidal and I could function ok.. Once I got in a relationship  things kept getting worse. I was getting suicidal and my mind was playing major tricks on me. I was always convinced she was cheating with no reason at all to think that and I would get mad. So finally I stopped the wellbutrin and tried Prozac ,I was jittery at first but now I feel much much better. For awhile on wellbutrin I couldn't leave the house for days and just sleep.. Now I wonder if I don't need antidepressants at all..",932
Prescribed Wellbutrin for Depression ,"I was diagnosed by my therapist and psychiatrist with depression and was prescribed Wellbutrin. A lot of my symptoms involve lack of motivation, overwhelming feelings of being uninspired, having a fatalistic attitude towards my day (like no matter what I do, I'm convinced of a negative outcome for a lot of things,) sometimes having random spells of being emotional, and feeling too overwhelmed to engage in my tasks for the day so much that I just end up sleeping a lot. When I do push/fight through to get something done, it feels very exhausting and often don't feel accomplished even if the outcome was great on paper.

My psychiatrist mentioned that this is not a stimulant, which I am trying to avoid, but that this would help with those symptoms, especially with getting my motivation regulated. 

Id like to ask if anyone in this sub has had any success or failures with this medication. How has your experience been? Did you have similar symptoms that improved after taking this medication? Also, I'd appreciate any tips you might have for when you're on the medication (i.e. drinking more water than usual, adding/avoiding certain foods, etc.)

Thanks :) ",933

Experiences Adding Wellbutrin to Zoloft,"Adding Wellbutrin to Zoloft 
Hey everyone!
*** I need positive stories please!!!!! ***

I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for 7 years and have been struggling with very low energy/motivation/dissociation/numbing for quite a while. I went up to 100mg and literally couldn‚Äôt cry for years. Two years ago I went down to 75mg and then 62.5mg to just yesterday 50mg. The other problem is I still have horrible anxiety. I get terrified of going out with people and often talk myself out of it. If I do go my anxiety completely dominates the whole experience. My anxiety manifests physically a lot. I start getting hot, thirsty, nauseous. Ugh. It‚Äôs dumb. I felt like my anxiety should be better if I have to deal with all the other side effects of this med. 

Anyway, I put off making med changes bc years ago I had a psych that basically took me off Zoloft cause I had RLS and tried like 4 diff SSRI‚Äôs, SNRI‚Äôs, beta blockers, antipsychotics, etc. over the course of like 6 months and it was a horror show. It was so traumatic to me I‚Äôve been terrified to try anything again since getting back on Zoloft. I never felt the same I first did on Zoloft but it was enough to stick to it.

I finally got the courage to find a good psychiatrist and explain the fact that I still feeel like my anxiety and depression is quite unmanageable as it holds me back from doing things. A lot. She recommended I go down to 50mg on my Zoloft and add Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm so nervous bc I feel like I always get the worst side effects and experiences and meds never work out for me. I can‚Äôt afford to have even worse mental health. I know I can just get off of it if it doesn‚Äôt work out, but I‚Äôm afraid it will permanently alter me. Kinda like before when I mentioned I was on a lower dose of Zoloft, tried a million meds and ended up having to go on a higher dose of Zoloft cause it wasn‚Äôt doing the magic it was before. I keep reading that Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt good for anxiety. My psych swears the Zoloft will counteract that. I‚Äôm just nervous. Zoloft already gives me a weird dissociative feeling that freaks me out and gives me anxiety and I‚Äôm afraid Wellbutrin will exacerbate it.


So I guess I‚Äôm asking‚Ä¶ has anyone who really struggles with anxiety and depresssion been a really tough pickle / prone to bad experiences with meds and had a positive experience with this combo??",939

Switching from Zoloft to Lexapro to Wellbutrin,"Hello, I (21F) had my first experience with antidepressants in the form of (25mg for 2 weeks then 50mg) Zoloft beginning 5/3/24. A month later, I switched to 10mg Lexapro cold turkey due to my provider‚Äôs recommendation because I wasn‚Äôt feeling better. Another month later 6/4/24, a new doc suggested I switch to 150mg Wellbutrin cold turkey 7/9/24 since I didn‚Äôt feel much different on Lexapro either. This doc said since I didn‚Äôt have any withdrawal symptoms cold turkeying from Zoloft to Lexapro I should be fine doing the same Lexapro to Wellbutrin. Today is my fourth day of being on Wellbutrin and I can positively say I feel significantly worse. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs symptoms of withdrawal or the Wellbutrin. I feel moody like when I PMS (sad, extreme loneliness) but on top of that I feel empty/hopeless in moments I‚Äôm alone. It‚Äôs making me anxious. I also feel like I‚Äôm withdrawing myself from social situations which is odd because I am someone who craves company 24/7 as a result of abandonment issues. Can anyone else relate? Also, after studying several Reddit posts I feel as though I didn‚Äôt give Lexapro enough time? Many people have said they didn‚Äôt begin to feel better until 6-8 weeks in.

Wellbutrin side effects ,"Curious how long it took for people‚Äôs Wellbutrin side effects to go away.  I only took 2 days worth and I had enough panic attacks and lack of sleep that trying to fight thru it for 2-4 weeks in hopes that they got better was not worth the possibility of losing my job.  That being said the pills were only 100 SR, so I thought the side effects would go away pretty quick once I stopped them.  Curious how long it took for other peoples side effects to go away after stopping cold turkey following a short stint on the meds.  I am on my second day after stopping so maybe this sounds like needless worrying to those who have experience, but I wanted to get others thoughts.  Still having mood swings and pretty bad anxiety in addition to the bad sleep.",945
"From pramipexole er to Wellbutrin, advice needed ","Hi friends, I know that's an hard question. But maybe someone knows ...

Drugs like Wellbutrin?,"Hi! Currently attempting to taper off 40mg Lexapro (5+ years). I also take 10mg Rexulti, which I will also likely come off of as it doesn‚Äôt treat depression unless it‚Äôs added onto another antidepressant. 

I really would love to never take another antidepressant again. Never found one that works (treatment resistant) enough to make me not depressed. Just isn‚Äôt really worth the side effects to feel exactly the same. I can barely achieve orgasm and have a very low drive, and i have a hard time getting excited for feeling happiness. I also have extremely low motivation and energy, even on meds. 

A few years ago, I took Wellbutrin as an add on to my Lexapro to decrease sexual side effects. Holy SHIT. I felt like a human being. I had energy and felt feelings and kept my room clean and got chores and work done. It made my heart race, which sucked, but I was willing to put up with it because of how amazing i felt. 

Unfortunately, I ended up being allergic to it, getting a full body rash about two weeks in. So i had to stop it. 

I‚Äôm curious, what other meds feel like that? I‚Äôve read a lot about Prozac being stimulating, but i worry about the sexual side effects of SSRI‚Äôs all being the same. Do you think I‚Äôd be better off staying in the same drug class as wellbutrin (atypical antidepressants)? 

Obviously I‚Äôll be talking to my doctor, but i just want to know what other drugs are good for energy and motivation.",947
just started wellbutrin,"hi everyone, i (31f) just started wellbutrin 150mg extended release last week. it‚Äôs being used to treat depression, as i was to a place where i could no longer even get up to shower.

Amitriptyline dosage / possible acclimation. Any stories?,"Hello all.

So I'm on daily 50mg amitriptyline for moderate depression (sometimes mild, sometimes severe..). I understand that this is a paltry dosage but please understand that I've always been medication sensitive and often have not need full dose to achieve the same effects as what is considered normal, and not just anti-depressants (I'm 100kg+ as well, go figure :))

It works, and the side effects are tolerable, however since being on it I've increased dosage twice after about 5 months as I felt like I was becoming resistant to the benefits.

It's happening again...

I'm ok today, actually feeling really good, but I took mental snapshot a couple days ago that I can refer to and things weren't good.

I know I should - and I will - talk to my GP about it, I'm not looking for direct medication advice that I'll take to them, **I just wanted to know generally if anyone ever found a dosage of amitriptyline that they settled on longer term?**

I also understand that it's a less common medication and that newer SSRIs or what have you are preferred nowadays, but I think the original psychiatrist spotted some synergy with Migraine issues I had (I only get about 2 a year now - woohoo!).

Amitriptyline HCI 10 mg Tab generic changed formulas for Northstar. Solution,"Hi, hopefully this post is okay and helps someone out.   


I'm on Amitriptyline for my depression. Recently my 10 MG pills switched from small pink with GG 40 on them to small white pills. And almost immediately I started having mental issues (kind of like brain fog?) and stomach problems (what I was originally prescribed this for). I talked to my pharmacist and they were still using the same brand (Northstar) of generic, but the maker had changed the pills (and presumably the formula).  


After we talked about it and she researched it she found that Sandos is still selling the pink with GG 40 on them. Presumably Northstar and Sandos were sourcing from the same manufacturer and recently Northstar changed. Hopefully this helps someone else because there is definitely a psychoactive ingredient difference at least for me.  


Also my pharmacist said this # would help other pharmacists look up the Sandos generic to see if they can get it in for those who prefer it. 00781-1486-01.",957
Amitriptyline - Emotional numbness or other effects that have stayed with you after coming off it?,"Hi all, question for anyone that was on Amitriptyline and has now come off it.

Have you had any long term side effects that have stayed with you?

I was on 50mg for a few months, then 25mg for around a year, and came off it completely around 5 months ago as I REALLY didn‚Äôt get on with it (and think I was misdiagnosed anyway as it made my symptoms 10x worse, as well as giving me weird arm tremors - which is why I came off it).

Obviously went through the fun of feeling like sh*t for a good few weeks after stopping it, however I‚Äôve felt pretty flat and emotionally numb ever since stopping it.

I‚Äôve always been a pretty positive person, never really suffered from depression, had loads of hobbies and was generally a really happy person.

However since being on, and coming off this, I just feel completely flat. Nothing I used to enjoy really does it for me any more, feel wiped out and tired all the time, lack of energy, zero motivation, and just constantly meh! Not sure if this has actually now caused me to become depressed, but hoping this is something that will improve with time.

I wanted to reach out and see if anyone else has had anything similar? If you have, did this feeling change or get better, or has this drug just ruined my brain for good now!

It doesn‚Äôt seem right to be having side effects after coming off something 6 months ago, as it would have been out of my system months ago.

Any feedback from anyone who came off this evil drug would be great to hear.

Thanks!",958

Some questions about amitriptyline and other meds and stuff because I have gone crazy,"Hi, at the start of this year I was having health and mental problems and after taking amitriptyline 10mg once I went down a really, really big hole mentally. I still am down that hole but not as deep. Is it possible that that amitriptyline could have caused me any damage or changes in my brain? Or am I crazy, it's all in my head? I lost all my feelings, It's become hard to think, I lost all my love and kindness and normal cognition. Is it even possible related to these drugs? Or is taking drugs like this from the doctor totally safe for my brain, it wasn't the thing that did damage? Even better if you have your own experiences. I feel like the drugs I took make my brain break itself. I did not take many and all from the doctor for less than a week each. I even remember at the time I read about PSSD, is that even possible after 10mg amitriptyline once?

Also, I look a lot older and my skin is very wrinkled compared to last year and the start of this year. Is it possible the stress did this to my face and skin? Or is this wrinkled skin aging natural or because of the cold weather?",960
"chest pain and anxiety, Amitriptyline (cyclic depression drug) prescribed and started to work","By end of March months ago I came out of a personal issue that had a 6-8 months long anxious period until resolution. 

Now when the issue resolved in march, it was a life changing time and decision and ended in a positive and a very happy note, what I was struggling for!

However here when everything started to feel very good I am contempt and happy more than ever even right now comes the twist in the tail.

I had gained weight in my personal issues and now after everything was resolved I started to workout AGAIN and quite motivated I worked out day in day out from 1st april. By 15th april I started to note a discomfort in chest after I finished my workout! Then the discomfort came and went in different times of the day for next few days. Then the discomfort made it impossible for me to sleep. This was now accompanied with a thought that I have heart problem, cancer and many other life threatening issues. And I kept on searching internet about my symptoma for hours everytime i laid down to sleep. It sort of became a sharp pain that would happen with certain movement. Eventually it happened to me one day during workout and I stopped workout. Until now I am in day time thinking its muscular pain in ribs and in nighttime when I cant sleep for hours thinking its something that will kill me. 

BEAR WITH ME.

I stopped workout tried some medication related to muscle pain etc.. nothing worked. And i had sharp pain whenever i was free or i wasnt busy doing particular thing. My whole back eventually became stressed neck and chest ribs abdomen... i slept but it was worse sleep one could get. I started to wake up with heavy chest. Now here I start self assessment at first fearing if i go to doctor something major is going to go wrong.. (i understand this thought itself is an issue).

Long story short I got all my tests, chest xrays done everything was fine. Then I self assessed that I am suffering from some sort of anxiety no reason for it. Here i started to lose interest in things and stuff so a month back after almost 3 months of fight I decided to see a doctor who staright away did an ultra sound and told me that ur heart palpations everything id fine lungs are fine. All you are suffering from is amxiety which has caused ""Devil's Grip"". He gave me medication of drug ""Amitriptyline"". And it has been working well from me. My chest heaviness is gone very very slight pain is left at times and very slight anxiety... after 20 days of taking it.

Now i visited the doc he was a general physician he told me that take the med when you feel you need it. Otherwise dont... 

I dont get how to to proceed to it. When to start eorking out.. i fear the pain. How to get rid of the slight pain i have occasionally... how to feel good and exit this sutuation eventually like before. Should i visit a psychiatrist or what? Is this a normal issue or what...?",961

Depression sucks.,"I'm not officially diagnosed with Clinical Depression by a psychiatrist, but I figured I had it when a neurologist prescribed me two antidepressants and a muscle relaxer. The antidepressants were Zoloft and Elavil. The muscle relaxer was Flexeril. I was 18 when I was put on these three drugs way back in 2008. I stopped taking the antidepressants in May of that year. Now, fifteen years later at 33, I'm having to wait for insurance to kick in at my new job before I can even begin to get help. I'll be in today and work, but I'll be asking the person who helped me get insurance when it'll start since having an anxiety attack on Valentine's Day during the dinner we were having at work. It... Didn't go over too well. It was so disorganized and we were given poor direction from the manager, and it was a total shit show. I knew for a while I needed help, that made it more concrete. I'm looking into doctors and trying to figure out how I'll keep me being on meds away from family. I have an unsupportive parent that believes that I'm ""Just lonely."" and I don't need medication. I do need meds, they may help keep the anxiety and depression to a minimum. No, medication won't cure it, but will make both more manageable to deal with in the long run.

Support please,"Hi everyone! I have started taking Wellbutrin 200mg. I also take clomipramine for OCD which has been fabulous.

Was my relief on Abilify temporary ?,"Hello, 

Diagnosed with OCD and have symptoms of depression , anxiety and depersonalization. Was given 2mg Abilify adjunct to Clomipramine 200mg. Felt motivated and had energy to get things done. 

When I increased to 5mg , I slowly felt the depression creeping back, and when I increased to 10mg, the depression came back full force. I believe the logical thing to do here is taper down back to 2mg under the supervision of my psych.

I am worried about 1 thing however. Was the 2mg of Abilify relief that I felt earlier a temporary effect? I only stayed on it for 2 weeks before going up to 5mg. I read someone saying that their relief on 2mg lasted a week only. ",969

Cannot tolerate any AD regardless of the class. (Please help),"Just wondering if anyone of you found relief in another type of medication?

I just simply cannot tolerate ANY antidepressant, within a few hours taking any of them I become suicidal and the anxiety is unbearable.

Hoping this will get out of my system soon because I‚Äôd rather be in condition I was before (was depressed but not suicidal).

I‚Äôm on only Quetiapine that I was put help me sleep and eat, it was helping somehow but after trying the clomipramine my sleep is broken, I can‚Äôt eat, and just generally feel terrible.

I will be trying TMS, hopefully starting next week but need some help whilst that. Thinking of asking doc for Olanzapine to sleep and see if it helps to take the edge of depression/ocd.

Dysthymia i need very good antidepressant,"Hello. I am 22 years old. I have dysthymia and ADHD. For the last 4-5 years I have been tired, apathetic, and don‚Äôt get any pleasure. It's getting a little worse every month. There is no anxiety, no panic.

I found something that seemed maybe to work: clomipramine, amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline.

Has anyone had success from augmenting an anti-depressant with another medication?,"I have been on trintellix now for 12 weeks and don't feel like it has made much difference.

Prozac and clomipramine worked but stopped working after several years. I live in the UK and doctors here tend to pescribe only one medication at a time/

I don't know where to go from here. I feel like I have tried everything. I read online that some doctors will 'augment' an anti depressant with another drug. This is the one thing I have never tried. Has anyone had success? If so, what did you add/take away?",978
Am i fucked up after all these meds?,"Dont know where to post it... i have a long history in psychiatry... im 33 yeats old. My first depression i got at 17 after XTC usage. I got on Prozac and got out of it. I diagnoses with adhd. Got on concerta and finished high school. Long story... i was on Concerta only from 18 till 22 and from 23 to 25. 

I got hospitalized a lot... when in
was 22th after a break up. 9 months in a clinic..it was hell. I even get flashbacks from it these days! Finally they got me kind of stable on Paxil and Lithium and i went to a recovery working farm where i recoverd good. (My mom uses paxil to) after i went out of there i restarted study and fall back...

I have been medicated my whole life( from 17 till 29 when i stopped prozac. I was only in 25mg serequel for 2 years... got my own house...and i felt really good. I felt free...!!! Free of all... no addiction. Just free..

But i got a 5th depression in 2019...after that it has been a rollercoaster... i went 4 times in clinics to adjust meds to try new pills

I tried almost all pills, combinations.... my shrink (where i lost faith in) they all say something different... i saw so many. Then they day you dont have adhd, you have shizo affective bi polar, my new shrink who sent me to Pro Persona a specialized clinic...said no you have an anxiety disorder, adhd, borderline, personal problems...and emotional regulation problems is now the term they are using en trowing to me... like wtf. I cant go alone to my shrink cause im afraid of her. Im afraid of myself, im afraid of hospitals..

I dont know how to tell.

But.... i went 4 months to that clinic in 2022. They put me on Parnate.. not working good. I tried Ketamine therapy. It worked.... but i also started Lexapro while the doses of ketamine where also raising. I did it 6 weeks, 2 times a week. But when i was above 15MG i got anxiety with the trips. I did not get relaxed into it. I could give myself all...couldt relax.. i was tensed a lot. When they got to the max of 30ML/MG i guess MG. I passed out really hard... thought of dying etc etc. So they put me back on 15MG and stopped the therapy and got sent back home....with Lexapro and Olanzapine 5mg en pregabline.

What did I wrong? Why they stopped it? Did it make my worse? I feel not alwyas depressed. But i cant enjoy the moment of life anymore. Stay present.  Im still thinking of my past mistakes. Cheated on girlfriend. Kicked out of house when inwas 25. I feel like i have some trauma's to...i was a really smart kid when i was young. 

(i was on Ativan 2mg a day, olanzaline 5mg and pregabaline 450mg bye the way when they started Ketamine)

Now i have also OCD thoughts and a lot more problems before i started meds in 2019. Restarted prozac in 2019 cause of i stopped it in 2017. I have read every fucking thing about medicine...about therapy...it messen me uo reading al these comments and info on drugs.com and revieuws. But im trying to get it on hold. With clomipramine it went better?

I dont trust my shrink. She said yeah we can do something about the meds, then she said no,. Then she says yeah serequel works betyer for depression, then she doesnt do anything. She doesnt work with MAO. I think she is not capabele of treating me anymore. 

I work out a lot kickboxing, yoga, trying to eat as healty as possible, journaling, walking,  seeing frieds...working voluentuer with elders, working at a thriftstore and farm..

I feel a little hyped now...

Im now on Wellbutrin 150mg Lexapro 20mg Olanzapine 5mg Pregabaline 450mg and Lithoum Orotate 5mg. 

I read almost everything about meds. Its crazy. Its my ocd also. I was on Clomipramine 300mg concerta 18mg an opanzapine 10mg. It worked also quite good. 

Dont know..time to sleep. 

Maybe the concerta fucked up my whole dopamine system?? 

In these 4 years of fucked up time of depression... i still think i want depressed im sure before WE restarted prozac in 2019 i overdosed  2 times...

I tried Prozac, Venlafaxine, Paxil again, Wellbutrin, Nortrilen, Citalopram, Clomipramine, Prozac, Parnate, Ketamine, Lexapro/Wellbutrin in 4 years time.. 

Im sorry for this.....",979
Question about ssri and wellbutrin,"Hello,

Im 3 years depressed almost. I tried over 7 anti depressants... 

First when i was 17 prozac worked. Then i tried it in 2017 and worked. Now it doesnt work anymore.

I tried it with wellbutrin and i felt better than whitout it. 

Can for example prozac and wellbutrin not working well together, and zoloft or lexapro with wellbutrin work well together?

I tried paxil, wellbutrin, nortrilen, clomipramine, citalopram (only 6 weeks), prozac, venlafaxine...

I have also adhd...and anxiety. 

My doc wants to try Parnate now. But im still thinking what else can we try...?? 

Brintellix maybe",980
Im going on switch meds; Parnate in the best Clinic in Holland for Depression but still have doubts,"Hello,

In a few weeks im going to a special Clinic for treatment resistant depression/chronic depression. Im struggling almost 3 years with this black dogg always hounting me... I tried so many meds over these years, some maybe to less time, some didn't help, some helped a little.. Like Clomipramine, Wellbutrin.

I also had and EEG where they looked at a database and could see if Lexapro, Zoloft or Venlafaxine would work. The results where Lexapro 1, Zoloft 2, Venlafaxine 3

Im 32 years old, im working out 2 times a week, 1 time kickboksing.. I have diagnoses ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, Pers NAO. I work, only half days at a thriftshop thats the max for now.

Im afraid that we now going to Parnate and im asking myself, what else can we try ? Im thinking about the diee√´t, i have at this time already hard times cooking a proper dinner for myself... Im now on Prozac 20mg and Olanzapine 7.5mg and Pregabline.

In the past Prozac lifted me out of my depression in 3 monhts! I started it back in 2017 where it worked also, but less effective. Now im still on it started 2019, stopped. Got on Venlafaxine (only up to 150mg) + Serequel 13 weeks, stopped. Then on Paxil, stopped, Then Wellbutrin gave anxiety without SSRI, Nortrilen, Clomipramine, Citalopram (6weeks), Prozac/Wellbutrin and Olanzapine.

I think not al SSRI's are tried optimal, only Prozac i went up till 60mg. But i heard after 3 times or more it could lose his effectiveness. Wellbutrin did help me energy, concentration.. Is it possible that it will work better with Zoloft/Wellbutrin of Lexapro/Wellbutrin instead of the Prozac?

I tried as agument only Serequel and Olanzapine, i like the Serequel more..

I'm thinking maybe Brintellix can help me... Or another combination with Wellbutrin? I never tried Intuniv or Clonidine... ",981
Thoughts on medication combination,"Let me start by saying I trust my psychiatrist. I‚Äôm not questioning his prescription.

I have OCD. Main symptoms are overthinking things, recently that I‚Äôm not good enough at my job and a lot of imposter syndrome. I‚Äôm getting lots of help at work, but I still feel I‚Äôll never be good and the thought of doing hard things is so scary it‚Äôs almost paralysing. Apparently I‚Äôm doing well.

As I‚Äôm sure you guessed, anxiety and depression are big problems too.

I don‚Äôt necessarily want advice on my job, because it may cause me to overthink more. It‚Äôs a great company which is understanding of my mental health. But any words of kindness from you that things will be OK do help to give me hope.

Because time management and focus (as well as not being in the moment) are big problems. I‚Äôve wondered if I have ADHD.

That‚Äôs the background. When I started seeing a psychiatrist, we changed quickly from sertraline which had limited improvement to Escitalopram (now at 30mg) which improved checking symptoms. As my mood was low, we then added Clomipramine and I king up to 60mg. These are considered high doses in the UK. That was around 8 months ago.

After some deep depressive episodes, and continuing anxiety despite help at work and from a therapist, I saw my psychiatrist a few days ago. I wanted to try stimulant medication (lisdexamphetamine)  for the possible ADHD. He agreed this could work, but before me taking this, his opinion was to try and treat the possible mood disorder too with lamotrigine (25mg what the hell a view of increasing to 50mg). This should boost the other drugs he says.

It‚Äôs only been a few days, but my anxiety and depression are still bad.

What are your kind words, thoughts of hope for all the medications? I‚Äôm hoping lamotrigine and possibly lisdexamphetamine might finally allow me to live and work normally instead of just overthinking I‚Äôm shit at everything professional, I‚Äôll never get better and will only be good at simple jobs ",982

Tried alcohol for the first time and I don't know if I can be happy without it,"Hi everyone. I'm 16 and I've been diagnosed with depression about a year ago. I'm currently talking Prozac and Olanzapine. A few days ago I was home alone and tried alcohol for the first time. I don't remember when was the last time I felt this happy, being drunk filled me with pure joy, I can't stress enough how calm and good I felt. I haven't stopped thinking about it since then. 

During our last meeting my psychiatrist said that if Prozac won't help me feel better nothing will and my only option will be to go to psych ward, I'm Russian so I don't think medications stronger than Prozac are available to purchase here. I think about it a lot, before starting taking Prozac I tried Lexapro and Anafranil. I've been taking Prozac for 6 months now and I don't feel better.

I'm afraid it can be a start of a much bigger problem, I'm not a strong person and I have a long history of indulging in self destructive behaviors and not being able to stop. I also have a history of alcoholism running in my family.

I'm concerned about seeing a doctor because my therapy is not augmentable much(I take A Lot to augment it without success). Also, I have tried anafranil cymbalta vortioxetine, basically the most used types of AD.

I‚Äôve had depression since I was around 13 years old, started cutting myself at 11. I‚Äôm almost 23 now and I feel like I‚Äôm living in hell, or purgatory.

Nothing's working on me(Need to hear your experiences with antidepressants),"I'm on 60mg Prozac, 225mg Anafranil, 10mg Aripiprazole, 350mg Lamictal for OCD, Depression, Social Anxiety and Epilepsy(which are all quite severe as you can figure from the dosages).

I'm scared of listening to new music, watching new/anime/movies/tv shows, and playing new games for maybe 6-8 months now as I get overwhelmed by emotions and intrusive thoughts way too easily so I run the risk of falling into heavy depressive episodes. I'm very burnt out from consuming the same things over and over for months and I broke down on the night of last saturday and had a crisis.  
  
I used to daydream all the time during my childhood and adolescence as well. Like, \*all the time\*. I haven't done it for years but I'm reminded of it now and I'm very scared of living in my head all the time again. I don't even know why I had been doing that. It's probably related not being happy and content with myself andthe life I'm living.  
  
2 years ago, I had a depressive episode after watching Steins;Gate that lasted for 3 months and during which I left home only twice.

I'm scared of something similar happening again and I feel that it's trying to come back even though it's been two years since I first watched the show. I'm watching some emotional scenes from S;G nowadays and I feel that that overwhelming shitty depressive feeling building up inside me even after all this time.  
  
I considered Electro Convulsive Therapy but Epilepsy and that turned out to be a big no-no. And I'm scared of it as well, can't lie.  
  
I used to do EMDR but thanks to the therapist I've done EMDR with, I'm scared of going through EMDR again.  
  
Cognitive Behavioral therapy and Exposure therapy are not available options due to financial issues.  
  
I have learned about Lexapro/Escitalopram thanks to Drugs.com and it seems to be a good alternative to Fluoxetine. I was thinking of asking about Lexapro to my psychiatrist on Friday but some research I have done after discovering it made me question whether it would address all of my mental problems, or at least most of them. I guess I'll ask both about Lexapro and any other Prozac alternative to him, maybe switching to another SSRI might revitalize me.  
  
If you have any advices or recommendations -whether it be about medications or about anything you think that can help me in general- and if you have used Lexapro before or if you have switched from Prozac to another antidepressant, I would really appreciate if you could share your experiences with me.  
  
Thanks.",1000
Doxepin,Anyone else become more depressed and crazy agitated on doxepin? I snap at everything‚Ä¶ also feel crazyyy bloated. I‚Äôm only on day four but man my fuse is short,1001
"Intense side effects from doxepin, how long will it keep affecting me?","Hello. 2 weeks ago I got started on doxepin for anxiety and depression. However I first started having effects from it since the weekend, and the only effect I feel is intense dizziness, as if my whole system was shutting down any time I'd stood up or lay down and still pretty intense even when not changing my body's position. So I stopped taking it, last time I took it was monday evening, so 43 hours ago. However I am still pretty dizzy, I'm wondering when this will stop as I had to call in sick to work because of it.
I appreciate all answers, thank you very much.",1002
"Buspar 10mg 2 times, Lexapro 10mg, and now added Doxepin 10mg","My psychiatrist just added Doxepin 10mg at night due to my depression still being apparent. I can definitely cry still, just not much emotion on the positive end of the spectrum at all. I had psychosis back in December due to stress, sickness, and supposedly THC induced. (Was not smoking very much at all) but I guess it was all enough to really break my brain for a couple weeks. I‚Äôm not on any antipsychotics (cold turkied Zyprexa after ruling out schizophrenia) and also have not been smoking marijuana. Also recently completely stopped drinking also. My question is, will such a low dose of Doxepin even do much other than help me sleep? I‚Äôm kinda going through the motions doing what I used to love to do, but not getting any positivity out of it. Is it still needing time to heal from psychosis? It‚Äôs definitely a lot better than 4 months ago, but I‚Äôm just hoping it‚Äôs not forever. I‚Äôm basically numb until I have reason to cry (which is better than nothing I guess). 

TLDR: Will such a low dose of Doxepin actually help with depression?",1003
What‚Äôs worse?,"Antidepressants or severe suicidal depression?

Lexapro Advice,"My girlfriend is currently on 20mg and for the past year has experienced near constant intolerable brain fog.

Antidepressant not working ,"I don‚Äôt like being on mental health medication but depression meds are an absolute must for me‚Ä¶ sadly Doxepin just isn‚Äôt working for me. It‚Äôs been over a year. I‚Äôm afraid to ask my doctor for something better because last time she saw me I was temporarily doing a lot better. Probably a manic episode now that I think about it. I don‚Äôt want to feel sedated but I know I need something that‚Äôll be more helpful because my suicidal ideation is coming back hard‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know why this medication won‚Äôt help. It‚Äôs very frustrating :(

I‚Äôd be happy with just feeling okay. Not even happy. Just decent enough to not want to end my life. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking for. Therapy sadly hasn‚Äôt helped much and I‚Äôve been in it since I was 14 or 13. I‚Äôm 24. ",1006
How do I bring this conversation up to my doctor?,"My doctor knows I prefer non-medicated options whenever possible but is understanding and willing to write prescriptions when I need them and work with me on my options.

Problem is a few months ago I was doing way better and considered stopping my depression meds but she decided I should wait just in case so I did. Well, now I feel worse. Worse than I felt when I tried to end my life a few years ago. I know I need stronger depression meds but I‚Äôm afraid to ask her. I‚Äôm currently on 75 mg of Doxepin (helps insomnia and depression). Does NOT help me much in either!‚Ä¶ 

She also knows I‚Äôve struggled with substance abuse in the past due to past mental health and medical records so there‚Äôs no hiding it. 

So how do I ask for better depression meds while also being clear I do not intend to misuse them? Like I‚Äôll do blood tests, drugs tests, pill counts‚Ä¶ anything! I just need at least a little bit of my depression to get better! Just enough to keep my nose above the water!

Hello there,"Suffering from: BPD, severe depression, 21yo M

i have to post what im feeling right now bc i cant do this any longer. I am depressed since im 15 and were fighting every day since then. I dont know what to do. I was on medication serveral times but i felt very different and i couldnt say what my problems are i just felt the way i felt and couldnt say why. I also was in a mental hospital but i didnt affect me bc i was on too many medication. I felt very like on drugs. Just like a zombie you know. I took Ecitaloprame, Venlafaxine, Doxepine, Risperidone, Olanzapine, Abilify and Lorazepame. But nothing really helped for me. Now i just take lamotrigine. Now i really feel like i could destroy everything, i have suicidal thoughts, everything is the same for me i could have millions of dollars and it wouldnt affect me.

Finally found a med that works for me,"I‚Äôve been trying different medications from doctors and psychiatrists for my mental health issues for 6 years and in particular, have not had luck finding any that work for my depression.
I tried mainly a lot of SSRI‚Äôs, antipsychotics, and random shit that was mainly, off-label.
It gets discouraging after a while of trying various pills and treatments because you end up feeling like a lab rat and you‚Äôre constantly trying new medications that it becomes tiring. I ended up stopping my depression meds for a while, and eventually, my other ones as well.

I came back to it recently because another wave of really severe depression came in at full force recently, and I haven‚Äôt been taking care of myself like I should. I ended up getting a new psychiatrist 
And ACTUALLY found something that not only lessened the severity of my depression, but also helped my adhd as well.
The drug is called Wellbutrin (bupropion), and I can‚Äôt explain how much it‚Äôs helped. I feel like my mind is more clear, and I can laugh at jokes and feel like a semi-normal person again. 
Granted, the apathy and melancholy from depression are still present but it feels like a much milder depression that Is **far** more functional that my usually severe chronic depression.
It‚Äôs sort of insane how long it takes for some people to find the right med combination.
If anyone‚Äôs interested, my med trio is 
Buproprion (antidepressant), Lamictal (mood stabilizer), and Doxepin (sleep med).",1010
Trazodone help,"So, awhile back, my doctor prescribed 50mg trazodone for sleep, which gave me the most amazing sleep I‚Äôve experienced.  Sadly, after about 2 weeks, I discontinued due to bad headaches.  I have not since found a pill that gives me a more steady, solid, achievable sleep.  We have tried mirtazapine (which made me dream all night, as well as rapidly gain weight).   We tried doxepin, which knocked me on my butt during the day.  (25mg, reduced to 10mg) and I never felt well rested.  I‚Äôve picked back up my bottle of trazodone and am again experiencing good sleep (and much less anxiety the day after!) but I know the headaches are just around the corner.  Oddly, they aren‚Äôt until about 22-23 hours after my dose (a few hours before my next bed time).  What could be causing this?  I hate discontinuing a pill that‚Äôs working so well.  Aspirin, tylenol, and ibuprofen won‚Äôt touch the headache.  .50mg of Xanax and it‚Äôs gone in five minutes.",1011

So, I started taking sertraline and pregabaline last october, and in february it just stopped working (the sertraline), but my psychiatrist wouldn't listen to my concerns, so my therapist adviced me to look for a second opinion, and, after a couple months, I started seeing another professional, so he changed the medication and prescribed wellbutrim (bupropion) and otedram (bromazepam), which I took from may to june, but the bupropion didn't do anything, so he replaced it with imipramine, and continued with the bromazepam; that until yesterday that I saw him again, it was working, or at least I thought so, because I was feeling slightly better, but yesterday he decided to change it once again, so now I'll be taking Valprosid (valproate semisodium). The thing is, I didn't ask him why (I forgot, and since it's part of the public health system, I have no way to contact him), and I've been reading a bit... my concern is that this drug is used to treat epilepsy, and at a minor scale, to help with the bipolar disorder and manic depression, more focused to the mania than to the depression part of it, and I have been just depressed I think.

&#x200B;

I don't know if he actually saw something I never noticed about my ""condition"", but I feel like the imipramine was working and I think we should've continued the treatment for a bit longer to see if it actually progressed better, because now I just feel like I'm a guinea pig that he's sort of experimenting with.

I'm conscious that I have to trust in my specialist, and since I'm no expert maybe I shouldn't be so worried, but I feel uneasy not knowing if this medication will actually help reduce suicidal ideation and improve my depression.",1015

"Nortriptyline: need help with stopping from long term usage, withdrawal, and recovering from damage.","I am in distress right now and need some help.

My mother (62 year old) is taking Nortriptyline 25 mg daily for past 11 years. In last two years, she had noticed some memory loss, confusion, and overall slow brain function.

Just yesterday, she resurfaced this to our GP and he mentioned that Nortriptyline can cause memory loss.

I am extremely worried about my mother's mental well being and overall brain functioning.

The original prescription was to overcome her claustrophobia and the doctor who prescribed it asked to continue the med for lifetime (I was a child to understand and intervene). The intention was to help her fall asleep (and to this day, she takes 25 mg at night, that helps her sleep peacefully).

We are considering to stop this medication, by gradually reducing the dose and frequency.

My questions

1. Is it possible to stop this medication without severe withdrawal symptoms?
2. If yes, then what are the potential withdrawal symptoms?
3. How can we help her overcome those and reach the healthier side?
4. Can her cognitive functioning, memory loss, etc. damage be cured post stopping Nortriptyline?

Treatment Resistant Depression: What do you do when you've tried everything?,"My husband suffers from extremely severe depression. His specific diagnoses from his psychological evaluation are Persistent Depressive Disorder (Severe) with Major Depressive Episodes and psychotic features, Personality Disorder (Mixed features - specifically depressive personality), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

He's been depressed his entire life, but his coping mechanisms ran out in 2019 and he hit bottom. He has been unable to work and can barely leave the house due to agoraphobia. He's taken pretty much every single combination of medications (even the brand new Auvelity), anti-depressants with modifiers, etc. Currently he takes 2 medications to sleep because of nightmares (trazodone and prazosin) 2 medications for anxiety (propranalol and hydroxyzine), and 3 medications for antidepressant (lithium, nortriptyline, and abilify). I have to keep his medication for fear that he gets into a dissociative state and would take his life with them.

He's done a full course for DBT and currently gets individual CBT twice per week. He uses DBT skills like opposite action every day and often he can tell when he's having illogical thinking but is unable to break the feeling.

He's had about 45 sessions of ECT and while they made the tiniest bit of difference in SI, they haven't had much of a substantial impact and he still lives in a constant state of depression and frequent episodes of SI daily. He's due to start Ketamine infusions on Friday and I'm hopeful, but also fearful if it doesn't work. He has a very respected and well known doctor who specializes in TRD and ECT and even he says he's out of ideas. He said we could try TMS but he doesn't expect it to be effective.

Is there anyone else out there like him where nothing works? Anyone who has had something that has helped? We are so desperate. I've researched and researched and can't seem to come up with anything else. At this point he's not even looking for remission, just some small amount of relief and the ability to feel normal. Not even happy, just not utterly depressed.

Thanks all.",1024
I need help.,"So lately, my mental health has been quite a struggle. I‚Äôve tried so many things in the past, from Prozac, Nortriptyline, Modafinil (briefly), Vyvanse (currently helping a bit), Wellbutrin, Pristiq, and the most recent trial, Lamictal. 

I‚Äôve felt like some things work a bit, like the Wellbutrin, but are really hard on my heart health, so it makes it hard to combine with Vyvanse. The journey with Lamictal has been kind of a roller coaster, and it just doesn‚Äôt seem to be working yet at 100mg. 

I‚Äôm missing work, I‚Äôm feeling unmotivated and fatigued, and I don‚Äôt really know what to do. 

I know this isn‚Äôt necessarily a place for therapy, I have a provider for that, but I did want to ask what you have tried that‚Äôs helped you, as my psychiatrist is pretty open to new medication/therapy ideas. 

TL;DR - I‚Äôve tried a lot of meds, anti-depressants, stimulants, and mood stabilizers, and nothing seems to be working. What have you tried that‚Äôs worked for you?",1025
Stopped taking my depression meds... having sensory issues??,"So I went off my meds (Nortriptyline, Abilify) a couple months ago. Which was probably a mistake but I digress. For some reason I cannot get comfortable.  My clothes feel weird, my body itches.  It's worse when I lie down.  I feel like I have to make little adjustments to my position but i never feel right, physically. If something touches one side of my body, I have to touch the opposite side in the same way or I feel off. I can't wear my wrist braces at night (for carpal tunnel) because they feel awful and I feel like I'm going to have an anxiety attack when they are on. Has anyone ever heard of this? Could this be from going off the meds or some weird depression side effect?

What meds to pick?,"Patient did respond well to (10mg->20mg Fluoxetine) SSRI treatment, but 1.5 year later, even after increasing dosages to 20mg>30mg>40mg, treatment stops working. 

Followed up by a period of 6 months without medication.

Wish for medication comes up again;
After some research and patient suffering from comorbid depression, ADHD, and Aspergers, Venlafaxine and Aripiprazole are prescribed because of favourable pharmacological action.

No effect after 3 months, new search for medication. Off label Tianeptine seemed like it could be very effective but wasn‚Äôt available in the country. Next are MAOI‚Äôs/Tricyclic antidepressants. MAOI‚Äôs tend to be avoided because of side effects, so Amitryptiline and Nortriptryline were the next up options. 
Assumed Nortriptyline was chosen because of less side effects, and more stimulation as a positive side. Unfortunately after 3 months it still didn‚Äôt have positive effects. Even after increasing dosage from 25 to 75mg.

Patient has so far tried; SSRI, SNRI, Tricyclic and Antipsychotic.

There's no such thing as help.,"I've seen a lot of people say there's help out there but I gotta be honest I'm 11-12 years in and I am still exactly the same.

First I will mention I am safe despite having a massive amount of suicidal thoughts every day. I've seen where they put you if they find out, sounds like genuine hell to me I'm so scared of it I shake with fear just at the thought. So it worked I guess? I don't plan cause it would just get my hopes up. 

Back to my complaint, there's nothing I hate more than people saying there's help now. I have asked since I was a teen for help I'm now nearing my 30s in a year or so they have diagnosed me with a few things since ! Autism, ADHD, anxiety, depression. Gave me a drug or two for something ? No idea exactly what they were thinking I mean the only antidepressant I'm on was actually given to me to help with my many digestive chronic issues. Nortriptyline been on it for about 3 years now. On propranolol for about 8 years now too. 

So that's all they did. They showed me how to like get better balance when I got my autism diagnosed and taught me a bunch of stuff I had already learned myself as soon as I looked up what it means for me but nothing changed. 

They kept handing me paper on mindfulness I told them I don't understand. That's it  they have done the same thing for so many years I Physically gag when people bring mindfulness up haha.  I do the meditation thing don't really do much I can only do it for about an hour or I fall asleep. Feel the same as I did before.

I can't exercise I'm chronically ill and I have no interest in increasing my suffering thanks. I lift weights with my arms that's all I can do. I feel no difference.

This is the 6th-10th ? person I've seen and 2 weeks ago they said there finished.  I don't know why but I was disappointed I should know better by now than to have any hope. 

I am so very very tired of this cycle of asking for help and nothing happening I just want to wither away in peace now . I've spent so long online searching because I  have learned if you want anything in this awful life you have to do it yourself but the nonsense people come away with leaves me frustrated. 

Even if I ask for help again from a gp who sees me as nothing more than a drug-seeking woman the nhs is a mess if I'm lucky they might look at me in a year. Why did I write this ? I don't know maybe deep down I'm still trying to reach out. People on the Internet can't send me away from my home I guess it feels safer than talking to real people

"Medication - confusion, options, help?","I have major depressive disorder. Been trying meds for almost ten years at this point on and off. I just not sure where to go from here. Any advice and opinions welcome.

Tried sertraline (zoloft) and lexapro - didnt do anything for me. Venlafaxine (effexor) did work for a while, then didnt work so well and upped the dose and I couldnt sleep and therefore couldnt function. But it gave me hope that medication could work and gave me a little taste of life without depression. Which was really super nice. 

But the whole not sleeping thing was a major issue so I persisted with trying other medications. 
Nortriptyline (Pamelor) - mood okay, lots of chest pain
Duloxetine (Cymbalta) - mood okay, epic jaw clenching causing lots of pain
Vortioxetine (Brintellix) - did nothing for my mood, medium headache all the time

Possibly suffering from Nortryptyline (Pamelor) withdrawals,"Hello, I‚Äôve been going through a rough patch for the last few months suffering from depression my doctor sent me to a Neurologist specialist who then put me on Nortryptyline Hcl 10mg. I was apprehensive at first to take it because I‚Äôm really sensitive to medication. 

Fast forward 3 weeks and I start to feel palpitations/fluttering, get spooked and stopped the Nortryptyline cold turkey. Both my primary care and the specialist said it was ok to stop the medicine suddenly. The specialist is adamant that I shouldn‚Äôt be feeling withdrawals because it‚Äôs such a low dose and I hadn‚Äôt been taking it long.

(I had also tried Fluoxetine and Nortryptyline both 10mg at the same and stopped the fluoxetine after 4 days because both at the same time made me feel disassociated and awful.)

Now a week later (today) I feel like I have been feeling progressively worse since stopping that Nortryptyline. I have gotten irritable and had really violent nausea and vomiting today, and couldn‚Äôt sleep at all the night before due to restlessness and body aches. Again I brought this up to the neurologist when I saw him today but he was adamant it was my anxiety (my anxiety has never been strong enough to make me vomit violently) and not withdrawals.

Personally I think it is 100% withdrawals from the Nortryptyline

Am I wrong? Or is my body just breaking down and something bad is happening?",1030
Extreme Indecisiveness/Restlessness - possibly due to Abilify?,"Hi all - I'm experiencing something very foreign to me, and I'm wondering if it's due to Abilify. I've been on the med about a month at 2mg, and I also take Pamelor, Gabapentin, and Lamictal. The issue is that (usually in the early/late evening), I basically can't focus on any one task/activity. The activities are typically video games, online learning, or tv/movies. But what's happening now, for example, is that I'll start up a game or an online learning course, and within anywhere from 1 minute to maybe 5 minutes, I'll want to do something else.

It's not so much that I feel physically restless, it's more of a mental thing, where I just don't seem to want to do any one thing for very long. It's very strange and foreign to me, because I can usually focus on a task very well. This also doesn't seem to affect me as badly when I'm working during the day (either at home, or at my office).

In terms of the meds, Pamelor and Gabapentin are pretty new to me - I've only taken them for about 2 months, but I've been on Lamictal for about 12 years for mood stabilization. I take the Pamelor and Abilify at night before bed, and I take the Lamictal and Gabapentin in the morning. So maybe it's not the Abilify, or it's a combo of the meds, or the timing of taking them - I'm not really sure. If anyone has had similar issues, or has any input on this, I'd really appreciate it!",1031
"Medication - confusion, options, help?","I have major depressive disorder. Been trying meds for almost ten years at this point on and off. I just not sure where to go from here. Any advice and opinions welcome.

Tried sertraline (zoloft) and lexapro - didnt do anything for me. Venlafaxine (effexor) did work for a while, then didnt work so well and upped the dose and I couldnt sleep and therefore couldnt function. But it gave me hope that medication could work and gave me a little taste of life without depression. Which was really super nice. 

But the whole not sleeping thing was a major issue so I persisted with trying other medications. 
Nortriptyline (Pamelor) - mood okay, lots of chest pain
Duloxetine (Cymbalta) - mood okay, epic jaw clenching causing lots of pain

"Nothing ever worked, until this one.","(Read till the end)
So i‚Äôve been diagnosed with MDD, GAD, ADHD. 
I‚Äôve tried all the SSRIs and SNRIs (& wellbutrin) under the sun, but either they didn‚Äôt work, or I experienced major side effects. 
Like many of you here, I was anxiously looking for other solutions, incessantly browsing through this subreddit and other ones similar to it. 
Finally, my mom suggested suggested me a psychiatrist who she‚Äôd been to earlier, claiming that this guy knew what he was doing. 
I wasn‚Äôt expecting much out of the new psych, but I did visit him anyway since mom had already booked an appointment. 
Pristiq was the only one I had not yet tried, so I asked him if I could just try Pristiq. He suggested that instead of an SNRI, I try a combination of a primarily serotonergic (SSRI- Lexapro) and primarily noradrenergic drug (TCA- Aventyl). 
I was hesitant to try Lexapro since I‚Äôd already been on it with no improvements but he wanted me to try it for exactly 1 week and let him know if I had any sides. Anyway, I experienced some side effects- mainly nausea and emotional blunting. 
He said that the side effects would go away after a month or so, but I was hesitant, and so we switched to Trintellix. We did not change Aventyl, since I didn‚Äôt experience any side effects. However, he said that had I experienced any side effects, he would‚Äôve tried me on Desipramine next. (I was aggressive for the first 2 weeks on Aventyl but that went away eventually)

After being on the medications for exactly a month and half, I noticed that whenever an anxious thought crossed my mind, my chest muscles did not tense. I could literally feel them trying to tense up, but not being able to. My sleep was better- I slept for exactly 8 hours every night like clockwork, and the quality of my sleep was so so much better. While depressed, sleeping was quite literally my favourite hobby. However, I noticed I did not want to sleep as much anymore. And if I tried falling asleep during the day, I was no more able to. It was this weird feeling of being well-rested. 
Anyway, due to my forgetfulness, I eventually stopped taking Trintellix 3 months back, and did not refill my prescriptions anymore either. I have had no withdrawal symptoms, and Aventyl alone has been working wonders for my MDD and GAD. In my perspective, I‚Äôm currently peaking at life- making friends everywhere I go, switched to Honors in university, holding a part-time job, playing sports again, and I also just started writing a book that I‚Äôm looking to publish. 

Anyway, for those of you who‚Äôve trialed on hundreds of medications and given up, I‚Äôd suggest you guys to give the combo of an SSRI (or Trintellix/Viibryd) & TCA (Nortriptyline/Desipramine) a try. I mean, what worked for me might not work for everyone else, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try, does it?

Additionally, I was on Lamotrigine and then Pregabalin as a last resort before seeing the new psychiatrist, but eventually stopped taking those because I thought they didn‚Äôt work. But looking back now, I think they worked better than everything else, but I‚Äôd still say nothing has worked better than the combination I‚Äôm currently on. 

Anyway, feel free to reach out to me if you guys want to know more; I‚Äôm obviously no doctor, and a doctor‚Äôs advice always supersedes some random redditor‚Äôs suggestion. 

(TL;DR-  Nothing ever worked, combination of Trintellix and Aventyl has worked wonders- almost magic-like!)",1033
Cymbalta/Duloxotine withdrawal: Suggestions for dealing with the symptoms or speeding up?,"28 yr old female who has been on Cymbalta for about 6 years to treat Generalized Anxiety disorder and Fibromyalgia symptoms. I was taking 60mg twice per day and then was only taking one 60mg once per day for 2 weeks as suggested by my doctor before starting a new antidepressant prescription: 10mg of Aventyl to eventually get up to taking 5 10mg pills per day. 

The reason I wanted to switch to a different antidepressant was because if was no longer working for me. 

I thought I was dying or losing my mind or something until I Googled how long duloxotine/Cymbalta withdrawal can last and apparently it can be up to 3 or even 6 weeks! It's been only one week. I told my doctor about my concerns about the withdrawal symptoms from the times I've run out in the past and that's why we tapered the dosage but... obviously it didn't work. 

My withdrawal symptoms: 
.

. Insomnia. My ADHD symptoms are so much worse and my brain won't shut up and let me fall asleep. When the insomnia goes on for too long I start to disassociate and have difficulty determining if I'm awake or sleeping. Things get trippy while awake like I'm wearing someone's glasses or looking in a fun house mirror. Sometimes its like I'm stuck in the Dolly zoom camera effect in movies where I feel like I should have physically reached somewhere by now...
.

. Severely vivid nightmares when I do manage to fall asleep every single night. Sometimes they will wake me up in a full blown Anxiety attack. I'll also wake up drenched in sweat and my entire body clenched tight. Even when I run my air conditioner as low as it can go in my room in hopes of it helping me have a deeper sleep, I can wake up drenched in sweat like I was in a sauna.
.

. Exhaustion from the lack of sleep, causing significantly worse ADHD symptoms, worse anxiety symptoms, causing very low mood and no motivation to do anything. I could burst out I tears over the tiniest provocation right now. 
.

. Diarrhea and indigestion. Either the stress and my whole life being out of whack is causing my IBS symptoms to flare up or its happening on it's own. I could eat something like beets at a very late lunch at 2pm and see the beets again at 7pm. Nothing looks fully digested. 
.

. Nausea, indigestion and bloating is making me very hesitant to eat at a regular schedule. 
.

. Vertigo/lightheadedness/tinnitus. Ps, this is not exactly textbook symptom and when the problem starts up again it is a bit of a mystery. Had seen a ENT and had an MRI a few years back to try to figure it out but there was no obvious cause. Essentially I get a pulsing feeling in my ears and a high pitched bell ""üéµbringggüéµ bringgggüéµ"" sound in my ears like an old fashioned telephone and sometimes my eyes flicker like the lights are dimming during a storm or power outage..... but this happens specifically when my eyeballs move side to side but not up and down.... this symptom might just be a coincidence too. Very light vertigo, mostly foggy lightheadedness. 



The insomnia, nightmares and diarrhea are the biggest problems right now and its making me beyond miserable and feeling like I'm losing my mind. 


Please, any suggestions? I want to wake up from this nightmare.",1034

"Skipping Tonight's Mirtazapine Dose?
","Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of a bind tonight and could use your advice. I've been taking 30mg of Mirtazapine every night before bed as prescribed. I've been on it since early 2020, starting with 15mg, and then upped to 30mg in August 2022 after consulting with my doctor.

However, tonight is a rare night out for me, and I'm worried about feeling too tired from the medication, especially if I'm drinking. I don't want to have taken a medication like this shortly beforehand and then consume alcohol.

Would it be alright to skip tonight's dose so I can fully enjoy the night without feeling overly drowsy? I'll get back on track with my regular dosage tomorrow.

Happy to put weight on just curious if anyone had recommendations on a healthy way to be eating a boat load of food. So far I've just been eating carbs which is obviously not ideal, figured maybe combining my new diet with a good exercise regime might result in me gaining some good muscle weight.

Appreciate any tips on managing or a good approach to type of foods I should gorge on!

Withdrawal Mirtazapine,"Hello all,
My wife is in psychological treatment, she is taking various medications (Paroxetin , Elvanse Clonazepan...).

Mirtazapine withdrawal?,"Been taking Mirtazapine as prescribed for a few months (30 mg). Had a crazy week and as a result realized that I missed my dose, for a couple or possibly 3 nights. The fact that I had missed those doses didn‚Äôt even occur to me until I had this experience and tried to determine the cause. I was driving on the freeway yesterday and was hit by this overwhelming panic, it felt like really bad vertigo/motion sickness along with a concern that I may pass out behind the wheel. Driving at any high speed was strangely terrifying. I‚Äôve experienced some motion sickness while driving after a bad night of drinking in the past and this was similar but exponentially worse. I had to pull off several times and it took a long time to get to my destination. It was still pretty bad as I drove back but was bearable with the help of a light sedative. I resumed medication last night and hope this doesn‚Äôt happen again. 
Anyone ever experience anything like this? Seems consistent with some of the withdrawal symptoms listed, but I‚Äôm concerned with how extreme the experience was.",1045

Is splitting up AD dose helpful? (Mirtazapine),"Hi everyone,  
I have been taking 30mg for 1,5 years now, before bedtime. However, I have noticed it doesn't put me to sleep that well anymore, as well as my depression symptoms getting worse slowly over the last couple of months.  
As Mirtazapine is supposed to be more sedating at lower doses, and more activating (depression relieving) at higher doses, does anyone know if doing the following could help?  
Either:  
\- Taking 15 mg at bedtime, and 15mg in the morning, so that it at least puts me to sleep at night  
Or:  
\- Increasing the dose to 45mg: 15mg at night for sleep, and 30mg in the morning to help with depression symptoms during the day?  
Or does Mirtazapine not work in that way (i.e. splitting it up doesn't change the effect)?

Mirtazapine: is it likely to get better?,"I finally started medicating my anxiety/depression two weeks ago. It‚Äôs been years in the coming, and I‚Äôm beyond ready for this step.

She warned me of potential tiredness that she said would decrease with a higher dose as well as the potential for increased appetite.

Do I need to taper off of Mirtazapine?,"Hey Y'all, first time poster here. 
I went from 7.5mg of Mirtazapine to 15mg a couple of months ago, and have been experiencing some hard to manage side effects in the past two weeks. I feel hungry 24/7, drowsy no matter how much I sleep, and I've experienced a handful of panic attacks (which are probably due to university exams). 

I originally started mirtazapine to increase my sleep and appetite as I needed to gain some weight (which I've successfully done!). In the beginning I welcomed all the sleep I was getting and the food I was eating, but now it all feels like too much. It's like I'm constantly chasing my blood sugar and nothing fills me up. 

I'm planning on coming off of it, but was wondering what people's experiences were? My doctor said I can stop it cold turkey with no withdrawals... But I have a sneaking suspicion this isn't entirely true. My plan is to gradually go down from 15 to ~11, then 7.5 to 0.

Mirtazapine weight gain sucks...,"I was on Mir from October 2021. While on it, I put on 5 stone (70lbs)

Looking for Mirtazapine experiences/opinions,"I started taking Mirtazapine 15mg on the 9th of May (89 days ago). Positive effects didn't kick in until the 16th of June (38 days in) which were phenomenal. It made me realise I have never had even a full hour of not being depressed and or present in my entire life. I've had more moments similar to (but not quite as good as) that since then.   
On the 20th of July (18 days ago) I upped the dose to 30mg after weeks of thought and coming to the conclusion that while things were better, the depression wasn't at an acceptable level and I was worth being able to be happy.   
Since then things have become worse overall - a little bit of general mental state at first, then much worse (on par with the worse I've ever felt) for these past two days. I'm aware that the dosage increase can affect this kind of thing for a while, but I'm left not having any clue how long I should wait. Should I keep going for a couple more weeks or should I be booking an appointment with my doctor to decrease the dose by now?   
Yesterday the extreme depression started mid-afternoon and lasted until very late in the night and today it didn't get to an unbearable stage until around 10pm when I went to town to get out of the house.

Obsessive compulsions seem to be the only thing within myself that can distract from the sheer horrific sadness and dread at the moment.

Does this side effect lessen with time? It‚Äôs really unpleasant 

I tried switching to this from trazodone. On the lower 7.5mg dose, it wasn‚Äôt an issue, but on that dose my hot flashes were unbearable (3 per HOUR). So now 15mg but dang

Mirtazazpine/Remeron is making me oversleep so bad üò≠ any tips?,"Hi so I'm on 15mg of mirtazazpine (for depression and anxiety) and I'm sleeping through alarms,  sleeping up to 12 hours and so on.

Drinking while cross-tapering (Sertraline/Zoloft -> Mirtazapine/Remeron),"Hey - as the title says. My GP said I definitely shouldn't drink while I'm cross-tapering and ideally shouldn't drink while I'm on antidepressants at all. However, I'm a uni student with a moderate alcohol problem (don't want advice on this, that's a post for another time) and not drinking for a week is gonna be difficult. Does anyone know how bad drinking while cross-tapering actually is? Is there any actual danger involved, or is it simply a matter of the medication will be less effective and side effects may be higher? ",1065
"Seraquil, remeron and klonopin","Hi there... I have depression, anxiety, and insomnia, apparently, as well as everyone else.

I have tried five different Ssri, and they are all crap. But Currently, I am taking Zoloft,3rd day, shaved down to about 40mg, \[because I think this is another crap drug, and I would prefer to toss this one before I WASTE life and run in circles, again.

My body is treatment-resistant to all... but Remeron and Klonopin seem to work to a certain degree. I am trying to figure out How to use what I have. I also take Seroquel. It works for sleep \[maybe\]. My question????

Seraquil and Remeron work for a few hours, and I am Awake. So, at that time, I could take Klonopin, which smooths me into the morning for Anxiety. But if I use only those three drugs. Would that mean that the Remeron would be a total dose\[45\] at night, and would that carry over for my depression?? I also have Valium, Ativan, and Xanax for backup. How would you space these...

Remeron (mirtazapine) causes abnormal heartbeat,"I‚Äôm taking remeron (mirtazapine) 7,5 by breaking 15mg tablet as a sleeping pill for around a year. Never had a problem, but then I got prescribed Paxil & Mirtazapine and my heart was beating extremely weird and fast and my heart was kinda jumping out of my chest. I also had a weird feeling around the body. I‚Äôve discontinued Paxil as I thought the problem was mixing it with mirtazapine. But then around a month later I‚Äôve started to have the same reaction on mirtazapine alone, and my sleep depends on this medication. I‚Äôm afraid to take it again, also afraid not to sleep well. It‚Äôs hard to really describe the side effect but I would say fast heartbeating seizure and following pain in vessels. I‚Äôve checked side effects and not sure if I have any idea what it could be about.",1067
"Wellbutrin, Prozac, Remeron Question","Hey y'all. I've been thinking a lot about my medication and wanted to hear about others experiences. I take 15mg Remeron at night and 300mg Wellbutrin in the morning. I was diagnosed with MDD in 2018 and OCD/GAD in 2021. My depression has honestly gone into remission, I have my days, but I've not felt my depression nearly as much. My OCD and GAD have been consistent, and have ebbed and flowed, but not relieved at all. I have a lot of rumination, obsession over things in the past, and have developed anxiety tics that started in 2018. I have intrusive thoughts all day every day, and some days it's a lot worse than others. 

I got on Wellbutrin initially because I really struggled with focus with my depression. It's gotten a little better, but my anxiety still makes it not the best. I got on Remeron because I lost my appetite completely and I became underweight and malnourished and almost had to me hospitalized. I also could not sleep on my own. My sleep has improved and I've gained weight, but my appetite has still not come back, which leads me back to anxiety and the role that it's playing. Prozac was the first antidepressant that I've tried and I remember that I was fine until I moved from 20mg to 30mg, and then 30mg to 40mg. I couldn't get out of bed for 3 days. I have a significant family history of Prozac and both my brother, sister and grandmother all were on Prozac and tolerated it very well. All of them did terribly with Lexapro. 

I'm in a dilemma because I feel like I'm torn between all three. Wellbutrin definitely has given some stimulating properties which is what I needed. But, it cannot and hasn't impacted my intrusive thoughts, anxiety tics, and other anxiety behaviors that I've had since I was a kid and still impact me. Food is still a big thing for me and my appetite hasn't come back even on Remeron, so I worry about quitting Remeron, not to mention it's helped a lot with sleep. Prozac I tolerated well, but ended up getting off based on what my concerns were at the time, so I only took Wellbutrin, and I know is more on label to address OCD.

I would absolutely love any advice",1068

Mirtazapine (Remeron) and constant bad/horrible dreams/nightmares. Does it ever stop/get better?,"**Mirtazapine (Remeron) and constant bad/horrible dreams/nightmares. Does it ever stop/get better?**

I've taken Mirtazapine a number of times in the past in the 15/30 doses more for my depression as shown below. I'm very familiar with it's side effects of fatigue, weight gain (which made me stop prior), and messed up dreams. I'm dealing with terrible chronic insomnia (onset and maintenance) and desperately trying to find something to keep me asleep as everything else has too severe side effects or doesn't work for maintenance insomnia.

I'm willing to deal with weight gain and fatigue to get asleep, but the nightly multiple absolutely horrible nightmares is destroying me. I'm waking up at least 4 times a night and 1 or 2 of them is in terror/calling out. I remembered prior the dreams were strange, but nowhere near the frequency. I'm completely dead in the morning because I didn't get sustained sleep.

To those who take it / have taken it longer term, please tell me, does this eventually go away or calm down?

UK Doctors that prescribe MAOI's?,"I live in the UK and was wondering if there are any private psychiatrists that prescribe MAOI's such as phenelzine or tranylcypromine for depression. I spoke to a psychiatrist today after leaving hospital and he seemed to believe the old myth about dietary interactions and was not familiar with the latest medical information showing there is next to no tyramine in most foods and thus no requirement to modify diet other than to avoid marmite or significant amounts of aged cheeses. 

When I saw a psychiatrist at the Priory years ago he said he would try me on venlafaxine as my first medication, and if that didn't help switch it to phenelzine, no pussyfooting about trying half a dozen SSRI's that all work the same way, Is this just an NHS thing where they don't want to pay for the MAOI's and just prescribe SSRI's because they are cheap and less risky? When a GP prescribed me phenelzine a few years ago, even at just 30mg my mood was better after a couple of weeks with no side effects and no change in diet, unfortunately I had to stop taking it due to changing medical surgeries.",1073

Wish for medication comes up again;
After some research and patient suffering from comorbid depression, ADHD, and Aspergers, Venlafaxine and Aripiprazole are prescribed because of favourable pharmacological action.

No effect after 3 months, new search for medication. Off label Tianeptine seemed like it could be very effective but wasn‚Äôt available in the country. Next are MAOI‚Äôs/Tricyclic antidepressants. MAOI‚Äôs tend to be avoided because of side effects, so Amitryptiline and Nortriptryline were the next up options. 
Assumed Nortriptyline was chosen because of less side effects, and more stimulation as a positive side. Unfortunately after 3 months it still didn‚Äôt have positive effects. Even after increasing dosage from 25 to 75mg.

Patient has so far tried; SSRI, SNRI, Tricyclic and Antipsychotic. 

Have you got any recommendations/suggestions on this matter? 
Any help would be appreciated.",1078

Epilogue


¬†Prologue:

Before I even start this √ºber rant, beware about swearing, it's hard even to explain all of this without intense emotions that I regained after years. To summarize what this is about without poetic title: abuse, struggle, pain, learning, recovery & cure [to some extent]. And lastly I would like to thank for all those dauntless, smart people on Reddit, Longecity. Without your ideas, help, I don't know how long I would endure. I am proud that after all these years I can share something worthy, that may help others and pay my debts.¬†

Genesis:

From start it all was like big domino, had shitty beginning to be honest. I was born from serological conflict, and with pretty many many more issues. Poor development in overall manner from young age, and disabled immune system which helped me to catch every virus there was. Then going to hospital for many weeks [don't ask how common it was]. Later on, some hairs would fall off, again going back to my second home and I was diagnosed with alopecia universalis [misdiagnosed with alopecia areata]. Boom magic, I lost all hairs. Was kind looking like an engineer from Prometheus movie lol. School was a blunt blow for me. I was commonly laughed at because of my sickness and looking weird for other kids. To make it even harder, anxiety has developed itself and straight for a few years I was wearing a cap all the time to cover my head. Also school staff found out that it was too hard keep me with kids because later on I became aggresive due to those incidents and I had to work with psychologist wich after hard year found that I have underlying ADHD, well, fuck. Poor focus, poor marks, couldn't even sit for seconds, acted like a true caveman. Basically no friends, I had few before school but later I got antisocial and retarded pretty much. And finally I was put down to home teaching wich fucked up negatives even more but I was top kid about grades thanks to this. Now from my environment view: parents also had very hard youth and struggled with things that I do not want to drag out due to respect. Imagine how quickly with that background my parents wrecked themselves and then me. Mother went cold turkey emotionally and was pretty much robotic thus poor at giving me already lacking attention which I was craving like hell due to ADHD and mainly missing love. But I could always count on her about health. And father? Mostly working. He was incredibly resistant but a bit too overreacting, when trying to temper me. I grew up in a strict and pretty much army-like discipline for most of the time. Only family members that I could count on were my grandma, who is to that day one of most brilliant mind and kindest heart out there and my uncle, he maybe didn't understand me but was always open. Beside my psychologist and bunch of friends I was pretty much alone, judged, and punished by others. I am way way above that negative patterns today but I really would like to say: fuck those bastards wich hurted me deep straight into heart.

Later years and call of void, meds:

Moving on, middle school was pretty much the same pattern with one important factor. I gained new friends like: both Jacobs, Dorian and many more. And I meet in that age most influential person in my life then. My depression went incredibly further wich pretty much drove me to seek more help and go on drugs because of suicidal thinking. So basically SSRI's did what they was intended to: numbed me to level I could no longer cry, get angry, joy was feeling lost for longest time. It left me in void, only with something that resembled me.¬†

Out of those drugs i've taken [I don't remember names but for sure substances]:

Sertraline - seronil etc. numbed me to zombie like, fuck this SSRI

Amisulpride - made me extremely sleepy and haven't noticed anything good about it, I could sleep for like 15h, no joke

Fluoxetine - pretty much did nothing at all

Bupropione - this was best because it made me craving a lot of things like smoking, watching TV especially Dr. House [and if it's drug that mainly is dopaminergic and kinda noradrenaline one so].

Small breakthrough:

Selegiline - and that MAOI which I learned about existence about was game changer in hefty 65%, thanks to you all I went to doc for it, it wasn't magic cure but oh man, I will go back to it later.

About middle school and that important person back then. On some hip-hop group i've met girl, looking at it I wouldn't say that it may become such thing. It was pretty much only one person wich appreciated every aspect of my personality or at least what I thought. She showed me that she care about me, chatted with me often and I could say that we took care of ourselves, because I wanted her to never live as I had to, guard her from it as best as I can. At one point I had such crush on her that I would go to my first odd job to gather funds and go to see her because it was like 500km or more. But I would get then get rejected, but not like: fuck off, rather: let's just talk. After some time her argument was 100% right, having significant other at such distance would be painfull and unfulfilling. Time passed, and then my ex-friend wich used to be some kind of mentor to me, helped me to get from amoeba to really smart person. Way he written, played instruments and painted, knowledge about most things was unreal to me. He also was depressed but come on, if you would be such an intelligent guy and also good one you would break sooner or later too. I didn't had person that gave me before so much gifts and lessons. Speaking about girl: I tried my best to show her how cool I am, each time failing. Probably worst loophole that I was into. After 2 years I think my ex-friend would get more jaded by life and become someone like Rick from Rick and Morty. But he was way more successful in life. I spended more time chasing her than thinking about self development. See what lackings can do? It's just like narcotic hunger that obscure reality. One day he would start to act in a weird manner, cynical and interested in helping me to get what I would want. So they added each other on Facebook and chatted [worth to note about age difference, 10 years or more between them]. Soon enough she would treat me in a way that I would be pathetic guy, little I did know it was due to him. He made up that my goal was to meet her personally only because I would to get laid. Imagine my reaction, I was in awe how people can be fucked mentally. But of course, living in depression and on SSRI is in pair with high libido, like lmao. Quite the opposite like many people feel and know. Then to clean my name because my only target was to end this bullshit by any means, insomnia didn't help either. I showed her screens of our chat with him and that it was photoshopped to look like I am some sexual freak. She was sorry but to be honest it finally demised my respect towards her, unfortunately not other feelings despite that they were weakened by this.¬†

Time for high school and pretty much even worse emptiness and more rejections from girls. But then I met one that after some time was interested in me and I was inhumanly happy because I thought that I am worth something after all [I know how it sounds]. We got to get spend time with each other, get to know better and into relationship wich started fucking badly due to her past and her ex that I heard about. I felt like something was bad but the most important fact was that I wasn't sure that I did anything moral here. It was another swamp. At one point I shouldn't bother with her past but at same time I wouldn't have any future with her if I didn't act. But the most straightforward thing was to just let go, with a weak ego it was time for another year of lessons also a lot of pleasure but with great deal of stress and slowly creeping alcoholism. I had finally to get off those drugs because it wrecked me and my stress got back, so I decided to pretty much to drink every time I could. But to be able to work in a bar and not to be some kind of hobo. There was slowly time for my first serious job in the hospital which I was scared about like hell and not kinda into because I felt the whole time like crap, an important thing: anhedonic [nothing and no one was important or fun to me, my whole life was like being a robot]. I left gym, forced myself to work, play games or anything to get head clear and numb.¬†

Hard work beats talent, nootropics:

Much later due to hard work it became a lot better in many aspects, I would even smile and feel love but it didn't last long due to my feeling that I am again getting unhappy. Even due to anxiety I was in great need of going further. And I firmly say that I fucked up it well too despite my tries to talk alot about feelings of others and mine & needs. Then I resorted to nootropics which may sound like witchcraft but it actually helped me.

Noopept for instance made me incredibly mentally sharp and logical [was taking for it neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects], without it I could wipe my ass.¬†

IDRA21 made my negative emotions more and more stronger but not so memory like it promised. Double edged sword but helped me to get on track with myself. I was of course aware of potential risks and thus learning about neurochemistry as much as I could.

Ashwagandha calmed me to the point that I rarely raged at everything but after some time I gave it up.¬†

Rhodiola, L-theanine did jack shit or even L-dopa knowing about blood brain barrier, dosages etc.

GABA and Magnesium (in form of glycinate) helped me just to chill down even due to poor bioabioavailability of first one but some people claim benefits still with it.

I had one big success with helping my GF back then with L-tryptophan which helped her greatly with social anxiety. Repeating, I never thought about myself as some smartass MD, always humble and vigilant to not cross thin line. Nothing lasts long. Then I would go back to gym with great results over time because I was working my ass off to get back to shape and show what I am made off. Of course I would learn even more about how to make proper diet, supplements and my body and it needs. Because what is strong body without strong mind and vice versa. My relationship was dying because I would rather work on myself which was funny to what I did previously. Worth to tell about is my experience in hospital during working here. As I attended to med school as masseur [what a wild ride xD]. But I worked at a different position and the lowest one which I felt. Hierarchy is really strong here unless you have the golden tongue and wits, balls. I've met so many wonderful girls in my ward, due to my antisocial behavior it was pretty tough. Still I learned here a lot more empathy towards patients, how to get things done under stress, about myself alot too. True survival school. And saved lot of money. Those girls showed me that I don't need to act like clown or pawn to be liked or noticed. I owe them really much, and to my great surprise I meet another girl wich also made me charmed due to her caring nature, ambitious character and humor a bit awkward but still getting job done [if you would look at me then, Jesus, I am no one to judge xD], hard to not mention her stunning beauty. Kinda tall with incredible eyes like a cat, a womanly body, and a smile that could warm you up even on the North Pole. But this time I understood that I could feel nice next to her and nothing more, it was complicated. Anyone would agree that there is no point in ruining someone life or even trying anything more to just feel better for a moment. Later on I finally for god's sake realized that alcohol isn't my friend anymore, all those hangovers and my health. It made me more social and gave infamous afterglow, but at what price. I could use it as temporary tool nothing more. Only then to get into a trap of preworkout with DMAA [geranium] which is highly stimulating and dopaminergic but also blows your heart, thanks to genetics I have a tough one. Because of it, my gym sessions felt like a walk in the park and I was so keen to talk with people on it, make new friends, chase life goals, music was like SPA to my mind. But it wasn't enough and I knew sooner or later I had to give up on this awesome crap. My relationship ended sometime between those changes. I may say what I want but despite 3 years of something that I am unsure of. I've got my life lessons on how to be with someone, and pretty much all important aspects: talking, listening, caring, acting and looking a bit to the future. Previously I would just be: Mr. How can I help you, seriously who would like a silent, shy and boring guy. Some time passed and some more mistakes, again timeloop bla bla.

Show time, Selegiline:

Then fuck me. I said to myself that I need by any chance to improve my life and feel humanly again, not like living behind a glass wall. Numbed emotions (only anger and rarely joy, pleasure), weak social internations, my small talk was crap, anhedonic, or self loathing rarely. So I ended up sleeping for like 4h a night to find solutions, thanks again to Reddit and Longecity I found traces of other drugs. Magic selegiline. I was really stoic about it, like this can do anything? I was wrong, oh boy. At first with 5 mg sublingually, I know that oral is the default way. But this was long enough before I did know about: 5-HT receptors and their functions, D receptors, noradrenaline and adrenaline & cortisol functions, glutamate-gaba balance, BDNF etc, and NMDA receptor, brain parts and their pathways, and cannabinoid receptors and just way way more. It's just whole galaxy of knowledge, true beauty, big unknown still sadly to even greatest minds. Backing, 5mg did something, but after time. It kicked me a bit and made me talkative. 10mg then where it's magic have started about two weeks. I was again, feeling smell of perfumes, food. My taste got back, food was like porn to me, I would say that I wanted to go with someone with pleasure, stupid things like sun was making me happy. My touch got way better, I wasn't living anymore in steel armor. All my emotions that were held back got released but in an aggressive and anxious way. First time I cried. Because my life just got back to me. I didn't know what to say. Then more important changes has happened as I upped slowly dosage to 15mg to see what would happen [sublingually like rest] but just for short time, I was in mood to try things that always scared me. Sometimes I had racing thoughts and acted impulsive, something was lacking so I backed to lower dosage. Because there is important difference between MAO-B and MAO-A dosage, reversible vs irreversible if speaking about it, and time that brain get to return to optimal levels or little above after ditching drug. Not forgetting about tyramine, which seems to me like a myth, but those sensitive to it I would be carefull even if it's weak MAOI compared to Parnate or Nardil. Personally I eated a lot of pepperoni and not even the slightest change in my blood pressure showed or anything else. Also it's better to watch with stimulants on it. As it does pretty much same thing as them, also with 100mg of caffeine I felt my heart beating hard like Rocky, while I was working out. So I added, due to my hypothesis, a Taurine which balances levels of GABA and glutamate by binding to GABA. After alcohol abuse I would have for sure fucked up system. Not sure if GABA-A or B one or glutamate, or just the way they fire neurons up.¬† Next was something to block anxiety and no doubts, antagonism 5-HT2a by Panax Ginseng [250mg daily up to 500 cause of pressure], no longer that advised. I would become a monk, without weird outbursts of emotions which sometimes overwhelmed me, but at first it was about an unsure theory of HPA Axis and Amygdala relationship that contributes to anxiety when faced with chronic stress that also produces inflammation [worth looking into]. And finally to end stack was Ginkgo Biloba 500mg daily that would in theory help with many years of post SSRI taking 5-HT1a receptor sensitization to serotonin which would make me more emotional. Take it all with grain of salt, it's never that simple like one thing imbalance, that why I've tried to cover all damage done by drugs, alcohol, stress and to work negative patterns of thinking. It worked like charm, I got new life. Also selegiline made me kinda tough man, no longer I need to ask, feel remorse when it wasn't normal. Just take what I need, act now not later or day dream, say no when I want, be who I want. And finally to let go to all things that hold me back. It just made me living thunder thriving to infect others with best emotions and power surge. Also it made every goal easier: like on it I made my beard with Minoxidil 5% [Rogaine] and dermaroller every way pleasurable. When I look into mirror I've no longer saw bitchy me haunted by past but a jacked and sexy man that have universal knowledge and just want to conquer and master whole life.¬†

Epilogue:

To summarize kinda everything:

Years of hard work with psychologist, 4 times a month

Trial of error with drugs only to get it done by myself [I told my whole plan to my doc - she is way too awesome and caring for country like mine. She was happy, proud that i did my research before].

Living with fact that there is no shortcut.

Sometimes you have to understand that it's worth to enable your monster side but also it's mandatory to control it.

Mostly depression is bitch which silences us like knife on throat with toxic thoughts or feelings [no one understand my pain or I am alone, this is not worth to do] ALWAYS SPEAK YOUR MIND, FEELINGS, don't be afraid, many people might not care as they have their own hell but always there's gonna be someone to relate and work like team to get job done. It's better than never. I won't repeat most brainless crap aka never give up, it's for chumps that struggle with eating dinner but not mental fight. Nobody can promise you that it will be better, it might be or not. But look at mine progress, I had this tiny yet colossal manifest of will to live, like dim light in pitch black. You can do it too, anybody can. I always had this feeling to prove I will cut this bitch down, show prowess to everybody. I believe in you and I hope it might help somebody, it's my only desire. Lastly again thanks for friends that were with me in good and bad times, and all those souls. You did more than you think. And to family as whole but mostly grandma, mother, father, uncle & aunt and her kids. We progressed so far together.

I've polished it as much as I can so it doesn't become too hard to follow on, I hope.

Thanks, because I always felt that I am living on borrowed time.",1079
Fighting,"I've been fighting so hard to stay stable.
I've spent so much money on professional treatment that most of my work pay goes to paying for a therapist, a psychiatrist, and paying back the hospital treatment that did nothing but tell me what I already knew about myself because my insurance covers no mental health services. 

I've been fighting so hard to stay stable. I let these professionals put me on antidepressants and now my body doesn't even feel like it's mine anymore. With such a small dose the side effects are still very evident. For any guys on Emsam, you know what I mean. Instead of waking up sad now I wake up angry and have to soothe myself like a teething baby. 

I've been fighting so hard to stay stable. I've been sober 63 days now. I've kept myself Ina. Routine that helps but it's still work, I'm proud of that. I definitely feel less dependant. I used to think the addiction was the problem now it realize it's just me. 

I feel so disconnected, I don't wanna wake up.",1080
Anger and feeling better,"I thank you for reading. I will be as succinct as possible. 

I‚Äôm 58F, wife, mother, full time employee, depressed and anxious 50+ years, first panic attack at age 17

I‚Äôm curious about the brain chemistry behind something I‚Äôve now experienced a handful of times. I‚Äôm particularly interested in how I can affect my brain chemistry to keep this positive benefit going. 

Let me explain:
For 35 years I‚Äôve been a Kaiser mental health patient.  I‚Äôve been medicated almost the entire time and I‚Äôve done talk therapy with maybe a dozen different people (1-on-1 and in groups). I‚Äôve tried a lot of different medications and am currently doing pretty well on 12mg Emsam patch and 600mg Lithium daily.  And since I admitted myself to the hospital for 11 days in 2003, I‚Äôve also been prescribed 0.5mg Clonopin; only a small number of tablets that I kept in my purse more for comfort than use, though I would use it when needed. 

Due to staff turnover I was recently assigned a new psychiatrist. We‚Äôve met maybe four times in the last nine months; usually for a 30 min appointment.  She‚Äôs been pushing pretty hard for me to resume talk therapy. As has happened more often than I like, the people I have talked with aren‚Äôt very good at active listening. I list the coping skills I‚Äôve learned and use, then towards the end of the session I‚Äôm told something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like you to explore xyz and practice using that skill when you next feel depressed.‚Äù  Of course xyz is one of the skills I stated maybe 20 minutes earlier that I‚Äôve learned and have used for years.  It‚Äôs very frustrating and disheartening to realize you are not being listened to by someone you‚Äôve come to for medical assistance. I frequently come away from my Kaiser mental health appointments feeling hopeless and often end up in a funk for at least the next week.  More appointments is not something I want to have to cope with. 

So this new psychiatrist doesn‚Äôt want to hear this. She wants me in talk therapy. And here‚Äôs the kicker . . . she will not refill my Clonopin prescription because she thinks my one pill per month ‚Äúhabit‚Äù indicates that I am dependent on it. Though if I agree to talk therapy she MAY consider refilling it. I was so surprised by the way she was treating me like a drug-seeking benzodiazepine-dependent liar that I repeated that last part back to her to make sure I‚Äôd understood her correctly. I had. 

So I took my Clonopin ‚Äúcrutch‚Äù out of my purse, got up from her couch, and walked out the door throwing that bottle and my two remaining pills in her trash can. I didn‚Äôt say a word to her. 

I went to my car, called my husband, and cried for the next ten minutes.  Sadly, this was not the first time I sat in that Kaiser parking lot crying uncontrollably.  After I‚Äôd unloaded to my very patient husband I found that I was intensely angry. Like spit nails angry. And the bout of depression I‚Äôd been dealing with for the last ten days was no longer there. 

Let me clarify, I am not and haven‚Äôt ever been diagnosed as having anger issues. I do periodically experience irritability as many with depression do, but my anger issues are about long ago injustices and grudges I will never forget. This anger I was feeling at this doctor is something that I feel maybe twice a year. 

What I want to know is . . . what‚Äôs going on chemically that feeling this spitting nails anger has snapped me out of my latest slump?  And how can I keep the benefit of those chemicals doing their thing as the anger subsides?  Is that even possible?


TLDR: Intense feelings of anger after a ridiculous interaction with psychiatrist has snapped me out of latest depressive episode. Why? And can learning why help to keep depression at bay?",1081
Quetiapine,"Hi everyone, i have been diagnosed with OCD and Depression and i was taking 80mg flouxetine (4*20) daily but it wasnt helping much and i still was not ok and allright. But i went to doctor for this and i said that i cant sleep so he prescribed quetiapine 12.5 mg (1/2 25mg) every night for sleep but i found a big relief and i felt the effects of it the day after. I was much better and productive and hopefull about my life. My question is is this reaction normal? Is it a good dosage to stay on or i need to increase it? I mean i hate the thoghts and depression. I have once tryed to upper the dose of quetiapine and i took 25mg but it was i think alitle too much if you ask cause i was completely suicidal and hopeless ghe day after.
I want to understand if its possible for some one having a significant reaction with a dose this much low? The recommended dose for depression is 100 to 300 mg daily so is it normal?",1082
Quetiapine and Aripiprazole,"I'm 35 years,  was diagnose as slightly bipolar not in the spectrum. I was on these 2 medication on low doses for about probably 8 months. I had to abruplty stop the medication since I can no longer pay for it. I've been off for 9 months. I've been non reactive  to any conflicts, but I feel real slow or poorly responsive, like I feel dull after taking it. What also bothers me is that I don't get aroused anymore or have any boner.  Like I'm desensitized to visual stimulation. I had a gf when I was taking it and it was hard for me to do the deed with her. Now that I'm single, it still bothers me coz I no longer get morning wood.

Could depressive make seroquel/quetiapine less effective for sleep?,"As above; recently I‚Äôve had a sudden dip of classic depression symptoms. Worsened by the fact that the off label quetiapine I‚Äôm prescribed for sleep seems to have decreased in effectiveness.

Even with melatonin and ambiem it‚Äôs not doing much. I have another old time antihistamine that‚Äôs commonly prescribed here that I can take for sleep it just makes me super groggy in the mornings.

(Other symptoms recently are pretty extreme mood swings where I get stuck in my sadness/hopelessness, causing drama in my relationship, trying to break up with my partner over something I normally wouldn‚Äôt react this strongly to, feeling extremely sleepy, no YouTube videos catch my attention and my hobbies seem boring.

Quitting Quetiapine,"I‚Äôve been on Quetiapine and Venlafaxine combo for the last 2 years after a really difficult period of depression that resulted in an inpatient stay.

For the past 2 days I have slept way too much and unable to get out of my bed. When I woke up, I have no motivation and lacked of energy. I am unable to see my doctor anytime soon. I am thinking of lowering the seroquel dose and up my mirtazapine dose in order to treat my insomnia related to depression. Please help",1088
Any tips with dealing with the sedative effects of quetiapine (seroquel)? Or any drugs with strong sedative effects,"It keeps me in bed for over half a day after taking it. I use alarms and wake up to them, but I don't get out of bed and end up sleeping until like 2 pm. My family gets really frustrated if they need to wake me up because I'll make one of those ""five more minutes"" promises and just sleep for hours longer.

I haven't been in school for the past year or so and haven't had face to face classes since, well, 2020 so my daily schedule hasn't really required me to get up at reasonable hours. I'm going back to school soon, and I won't have my family to (try to) wake me up, so I do really need to get my shit together.

I always mention my sleeping issues to my psychiatrist every session. I've went from 10 mg to 20 mg, though not just for the sedative issues but also for the depression. She says that it's less sedative at higher doses, though I really don't feel it. I'm also currently on immediate release because I was on extended release for some reason. I haven't explicitly talked to my psych about quitting, partially because I don't want to tell her for some reason, and also because nothing can make me sleep if I skip a dose, even other sedative drugs I've tried (don't want to go into that because I already hate being dependant on one drug for sleep), so I can't imagine going days of sleep deprivation to get that out of my system.

Aside from that, I've been recommended to make some lifestyle changes, namely physical activity, even if it's just walking. I've also been told to indulge in my creative hobbies so that there's something I look forward to when I wake up, because I do manage to wake up early on days I have appointments or plans with friends.

I think my sleeping issues are deeply psychological in nature. I don't think about my responsibilities the moment I wake up. I just make excuses for myself to stay asleep. I don't look forward to anything most of the time because I don't exactly enjoy being alive. That's why I get advised to engage in my hobbies, so that there's something I have to enjoy. However, I just feel like once I get up, I need to go brush my teeth and feed myself because I'll feel uncomfortable and nasty if I don't, like I need to do those things before anything else, so I stay in bed to put them off. Consequently, I don't really get to do the lifestyle changes my therapists tell me to because I already get drained after brushing, eating, and cleaning up. I'm a bad patient.",1089

Quetiapine has completely stopped psychosis and ruminating, and intrusive thoughts .anxiety is still very noticeable tho , and recently depression has gotten a lot worse .

Stopping seroquel for major depression,"Hi!  
I have a plan with my psychiatrist to stop taking seroquel depot. I'm currently taking it for major depression. I'm on 200 mg and the plan is to lower the dose with 50mg every few weeks. The other day I started taking 150 mg and I have barely slept at all. Does anyone know or have experieced any other side effects and how long they lasted? 

I also have a question regarding weight. Ever since I started taking seroquel I've gained a significant amount of weight, which i know is a side effect. If anyone else has experienced the same thing and then stopped taking seroquel, was it hard to lose that weight? Did you automatically just lose weight after a while?

Thankful for any advice or answers. ",1092
Seroquel & Lamotrigine,"I‚Äôve been on seroquel for about 5 weeks, 50 mg. For one of those weeks I took 100 mg but it made me feel like shit and unable to function, and I couldn‚Äôt breathe out of my nose at all for 3 hours after taking 100 mg every time. I also have trouble breathing on 50mg and have woken up sometimes feeling like I‚Äôm suffocating. My doctor still told me I should have given the 100mg a long chance but I told him no, I want to come off of Seroquel altogether, but he asked me to keep taking the 50mg until I build up Lamotrigine in my system. I kept explaining to him that I cannot breathe and it‚Äôs not the right medication for me. I‚Äôm going to ween off of Seroquel myself (taking 25mg), but just wondering what you guys experience is with it, or any experience regarding arguing about drugs with your doctor. I‚Äôm seeing a different doctor in a month. ",1093
Seroquel fatigue,"Heya! First time posting here. Hope y'all are having a good day <3

I've been struggling with depression for years now and finally worked up the strength and courage to seek help. After speaking to a psychiatrist they prescribed me Quetiapine to help with overthinking at night and insomnia. 
I took my first pill last night (50mg) and it knocked me out cold for 12 hours. I'm still extremely drowsy and fatigued.
Is there anybody who has had similar experiences with Seroquel? Does it get better with time? 

Thanks so much in advance! Hope all of you are having an amazing day. <3",1094

"Anxiety attack on a cruise (Kratom intake schedule messed up), now on 200mg Zoloft, 200mg Seroquel, 1mg Ativan, etc.","I still can't believe this happened while on a vacation of all things. I guess the most annoying part of the entire process was the process itself; getting documents in order (Customs) as well as any additional fees due to liability etc.

&#x200B;

So yeah. I broke down in the shower of my cabin. Thankfully I wasn't alone and had a lot of family members that showed up. But most of them had kids. My sister and I were the only one's that didn't have a family of our own.

&#x200B;

The thought of having to do things independently was a shock. (Yeah... I'm a worker ant I guess you could say. OCD to the core and always needful of a schedule) I should mention that I was on Kratom at the time and just 40mg of Celexa, 60mg of Propranolol for sleep, 10mg Lisinopril for blood pressure, and 50mg of Quetiapine for sleep. The heavy lifter of course was the Kratom.

&#x200B;

I just remember the Kratom being less effective as I became more aware of my surroundings as the days went on during the cruise. I guess I was having better/more fulfilling moments than what the kratom could provide so I didn't think of it until after I came home.

&#x200B;

Once I returned home, my dad dropped me off at my apartment. And ever since that moment I've had intense anxiety. Enough to be voluntarily sent to Inpatient Care, then braving enough to wait to talk to an actual Psychiatrist who gradually brought me up to 200mg Zoloft... 200mg Seroquel... 1mg Ativan... (Family doctor... I was so exhausted that I was going to end it all but he saved my life with this drug) 10mg Buspar, vitamin D3 in the mornings... and still 60mg Propranolol.

&#x200B;

I've been working out. But not as intense. I probably should but I can't muster the willpower. I can only find myself to walk 30+ minutes daily. Whereas I used to bike, weight lift and bench press.

&#x200B;

Can someone tell me what the hell is going on inside my brain? Why would this single moment cause anxiety? Enough to the point that the Kratom I subconsciously would take would no longer be effective?

&#x200B;

I feel like my body is now obsessive with homeostasis. OBSESSED. It has to preserve itself and anything I put into it, it seems to now reject. I feel there is something wrong with me where I no longer accept Kratom (I now take buprenorphine naloxone sublingual patches... and even those are not effective any longer).

&#x200B;

How can I be this anxious by going on a cruise of all places (I even was crying during the movies they were showing, as though I were sick). Enough that I am diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder Severe? Is it testosterone? I feel so confused. I feel like I have re-entered into the world, hypervigilant, gambling with sleep cycles... super aware...

&#x200B;

My mother mentioned she had this happen around the same age (40ish). I wonder if this is genetic. It seems most of my family has had anxiety. But my mother tells me my anxiety is really bad. I think this is because I long for the comfort of Kratom still, but taking it again is temporary and I am always aware that it will wear out and I will be back to my anxious self.

There hasn‚Äôt been a significant change seen with treatment and medication and I‚Äôm trying to figure out next options. I wanted to see what other‚Äôs experience has been with any of these meds or TMS with depression/anxiety. My psychiatrist brought up esketamine as a potential option as well? Any experiences with that?",1107
i‚Äôve tried (almost) everything,"i was first put into treatment when i was 4 years old. i just turned 20. i still haven‚Äôt gotten better. my mom said that when i was 9 i had a few months where i was less symptomatic, and again when i was 18, but i‚Äôve never experienced anything close to recovery. i‚Äôve tried everything:

medications

my dad‚Äôs 50, and he‚Äôs been depressed and suicidal his whole life. i‚Äôm scared that‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna happen to me. from an objective, statistical standpoint, i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs realistic for my life to ever be bearable. 

after 16 years of treatment, i think it‚Äôs time to just accept it. i posted this whole laundry list of treatment because i feel like i just need someone else to see it - i‚Äôve tried almost everything, and i haven‚Äôt even started to get better.",1108
"massive debt from Spravato, any advice?","So I started Spravato in 2022 and I had 15 doses. Because I needed to get back on my daily 1 mg Xanax (I jumped off a bridge from panic attacks), they refused to treat me. I got mail today staring that I needed treatment for ""substance abuse"" and my ""misuse of benzodiazepines"", basically a scathing letter calling me a drug addict... From a fucking Ketamine clinic... for being on my medication I need to be on. They literally cast so much judgment on me without knowing anything about my situation at all and basically called me a junkie and told me to fuck off.

I don't drink or do drugs. I am extremely insulted and I feel like people giving you Ketamine through your nose should know more about the stigma surrounding benzodiazepines, and how it is necessary for some people, and can be used responsibly. They didn't have any issues with their patients on painkillers/amphetamines. I just don't see how they're giving you shit that literally gets you high as fuck, but needing small dose Xanax for legit issues is a big deal. I don't notice anything from Xanax but sure as shit noticed earth-bending effects from Ketamine, these two are not even remotely in the same ballpark which is why it doesn't make sense.

I haven't drank alcohol in YEARS... But they'll treat patients that drink. It's fucked.

Anyway, they also decided to include in the letter that my insurance did not cover my Spravato.. ever. I was going in only paying $10 for each treatment. And they didn't say a single time that insurance was having an issue with it. Only now, 6 months after my last dose, do they tell me that my insurance didn't cover it.

I haven't got any bills but I can only assume I am thousands of dollars, probably $10k + in medical debt.

What can I do here? Never doing this again. This was a horrible experience and where I live, these clinics are shady. Honestly feel like I just got scammed/fucked over here, not once did they mention my insurance wasn't covering it, they were telling me it covered it every time.

Can I call my insurance and ask them to forgive my Spravato treatments? I can't pay for this. There's literally no way. I'm legit about to be homeless here in a little bit.

If I don't pay am I going to get in trouble or something? I literally have nothing, no money, this was my last ditch effort at life and I'm done now.",1109
Are there any treatments left after TMS and Spravato?,"I already tried 14 antidepressants, TMS, and Spravato. I'm desperate for anything that can make me feel better. Is there anything left? It feels like I'm at the end of the road, and that I've exhausted all options.",1110
Next step?,"12+ years depressed. I've seen multiple therapists and psychiatrists. I tried TMS in 2021 and I'm at the end of another round now. I tried Spravato last year until my insurance wouldn't cover it anymore. I've submitted my DNA to Genomind for optimal medication suggestions (nothing notable). 
Currently I'm taking Auvelity, Lamictal, Latuda and Xanax. I have a list of literally 13 different medications I've tried over the years that have either done nothing for me or I had a bad reaction to. 
I just don't know what to do anymore. 
I've never been admitted to hospital and never attempted suicide but I'm afraid that's the direction I'm going in. 
Fellow redditors, what do you suggest?",1111
Failing,"I can‚Äôt keep existing like this. This depression is so heavy, it‚Äôs crushing me. It is physically painful at this point.

I failed 20+ medications, yes we tried the genetic testing.

I failed TMS.

I failed Spravato esketamine.

I‚Äôve been in therapy almost 20 years. I‚Äôve tried CBT, I‚Äôve tried DBT. I feel like i hit a wall with therapy a while ago, we're getting nowhere. I don‚Äôt want to do ECT.

Where do I go from here? Why should I even keep trying, why on earth would I believe there is any amount of hope for me?

I feel like my brain is dying. I am actively getting more and more stupid and I can‚Äôt stop weeping for no real reason. I‚Äôm failing my family.

I want to disappear. It‚Äôs too painful.",1112
Hopeless,"Do things get better? Therapy (individual and multiple groups) and medication haven't helped. My psychiatrist recommended Spravato and TMS. Spravato made me significantly worse. TMS started to make me feel like I was moving in a better direction, but then I went back to feeling hopeless and empty. I'm tired of being ""treatment-resistant."" It just makes me feel like an even bigger failure and I'm scared of the other suggestions my psychiatrist said could come next (I know I don't have to do anything, but I'm really suffering). At this point I'm sort of trying to get back to how I was before therapy and I really hated that person.",1113
I wish I was dead,"I make $180k a year in a tech job. I have a family that loves me. None of it means shit to me. I don't want to be here. I've been on many medications (including spravato, which is supposed to be the be-all-end-all), many therapists (therapy is a fucking joke). I just want to splatter my brain all over the wall and be fucking done with it.",1114
My mother sabotaged my treatment and I want to die. [XL],"I‚Äôve been depressed since I was a child and have been having suicidal thoughts since I was 8. After many many years of trying to get better with suicide attempts and hospitalizations and trying nearly every category of med available I had finally found something that was working: Spravato. 

It‚Äôs an experimental treatment for treatment resistant depression. I was doing it for less than 3 months. It takes much longer than that for it to basically rewire the brain to think differently. But I was smiling again, dancing to Christmas songs, finally feeling hopeful after having to drop out of college due to a nervous breakdown during the summer. 

Then the insurance basically said ‚Äúnah u messed up‚Äù when they didn‚Äôt send a letter saying they changed my prescription to once a week to the office. I couldn‚Äôt get any more treatments. The office was going to do an appeal for me and get me in for TMS (look it up) treatments in the meantime. I was scared but still hopeful. I should‚Äôve recognized the red flags from my mother when she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt understand how this could happen‚Äù. 

She called the office when I was unaware and apparently exploded on them for idiotic reasons like ""not answering the phone"". Due to that they kicked me out. She hid the letter from the office from me saying that I was fired as a patient. I just found it today after asking about my appeal with her. 

I am devastated. This was basically one of two offices in this region that even offer Spravato. It is the only one I know of that offers TMS. I feel betrayed and hurt. 

I was crying the day after we went home from the office after they told me I couldn‚Äôt get the Spravato treatment because she said she was tired of driving me to and from my Spravato appointments that only occurred twice a week close to our house. I legally cannot drive after the appointment. I started crying because I felt unsupported and overwhelmed because the ONE THING that was working wasn‚Äôt an option anymore. 

She yelled at me and told me to go upstairs just like she used to when I cried as a kid. It  triggered me (I have CPTSD from my childhood abuse at the hands of her, my father, and peers at school) so I basically had a panic attack and dragged myself upstairs as she kept yelling at me. I said ‚Äúyea love you too‚Äù while sobbing and later she yelled at me for it. 

She then left to go see her father for 2 days and I exploded on her when she started texting me about how much she‚Äôs done for me and all that. I basically said ‚ÄúI was getting better for once in my life and you ruined it. I feel like I want to die because of this. As my mother you should want to support me but you refuse to do anything that remotely inconveniences you even if it‚Äôs literally saving your only child‚Äôs life‚Äù 

She came back and has been acting strange since. Basically I think she‚Äôs faking that she‚Äôs happier than ever. Meanwhile I‚Äôve been searching for how to get drugs so I can die. My psychiatrist gave me a new medicine that came out only 3 weeks ago. I plan to live through the holidays then die. I won‚Äôt leave a letter. Just like my grandma.",1115
So isolated and don‚Äôt have energy to change or talk to people,"Just turned 40. Couple years out of an abusive relationship. Lost the place I loved and a community. 

I‚Äôm in therapy, starting Spravato treatment, have a dog‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm just so exhausted I can‚Äôt make the concrete changes I need to in order to really improve things (exercising, making friends). Most days I can walk my dog, but not 2x a day like I used to. Microwaved some frozen green beans for dinner. Have a sink full of dishes. Sheets are in the dryer, haven‚Äôt had the energy to make my bed for three days so I‚Äôm sleeping on the couch. And no one knows (except you, if you‚Äôve gotten this far).  

The place I live is kind of isolating itself, and it really takes effort to get out and meet people. I‚Äôve tried, I just don‚Äôt seem to connect with people. It‚Äôs exhausting to keep trying. All my energy goes to work and putting on a happy face so I can keep feeding my dog. 

I live far from family ‚Ä¶ no one but my mom talks to me much, even then she‚Äôs not particularly emotionally available. 

I guess that‚Äôs all; I just need someone to know where I‚Äôm at. ",1116
"Just finished TMS, no change whatsoever. I feel demoralized.","I was really optimistic prior to doing it. Sure, I took a dozen antidepressants before then, and tried plenty of therapists, but I thought TMS may have a decent effect. Welp, there goes another treatment. I feel totally crushed. I‚Äôm currently doing Spravato, and if that doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôll do ECT. But if ECT won‚Äôt work, I feel like nothing else will.",1117
Ketamine booster failed,"I had a booster ketamine infusion for depression at PTSD five days ago. And I feel worse, if nothing else. I have had nine previous infusions and this is the first one to fail. I am crushed. The promise of relief is all that got me through these last couple weeks. She didn‚Äôt give me the sane dose the last treatment provider gave me. Now she is recommending another treatment. They cost $500 per session. I was counting on it. When she said we‚Äôd ‚Äúsee how it goes‚Äù at the lower dose, my heart sank. I was worried about this exact scenario. So I‚Äôm out another $500 and another day‚Äôs work. I am self-employed. I am at my breaking point. My marriage is failing. I am failing abd/or behind at work. I am drowning in the grief of multiple losses in the last couple years. My vagus nerve is overstimulated from the trauma of the last two years, causing me to lose 100 lbs and struggle constantly to maintain my weight. I am in fight or flight mode constantly and my gut constantly aches from stress. And I have been clinically depressed for most of the last two years. I do not know how I get out of this. It is very hard to exist right now.",1118
Wit‚Äôs end- even ketamine didn‚Äôt help,"I‚Äôm sorry to launch into a stream of upset consciousness but I‚Äôm hitting a wall time and time again. I carved out two weeks to try the initial doses of a ketamine therapy program that‚Äôs entirely remote, but after this second dose, twice the initial amount I was given as a tester and I still haven‚Äôt hit any fundamental new ground in my thought patterns or behavior, in fact grinding down into a new low of feeling too f***ed up for even horse tranquilizers. 
For context, I did talk therapy for years with different folks throughout what‚Äôs probably a 15 year span starting in adolescence with several SI episodes in between, had only one therapist I felt truly ‚Äúsaw‚Äù me but she became way too expensive to afford after the pandemic hit. I did a week of inpatient fall of 2020 to try SSRIs in a controlled environment and the effects were minimal, slightly better focus and energy but still plagued by self hate and hopelessness. Also my appetite supression/eating disorder hasn‚Äôt been effectively treated by anyone, I go for spells without eating, no desire at all, and this causes no alarm because I was a heavier person before and all anyone can really see now is me looking closer to an industrial standard of beauty, so in essence, better than I did when I was ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. 
I feel like I‚Äôm nothing but a poorly stitched together mannequin of masks and I‚Äôm tired of most of the responses I‚Äôm getting being some sort of puzzlement as to why I could possibly be this unhappy, and folks beginning to give up on me as I have on myself.",1119
Sharing ketamine treatment experiences,"I‚Äôm hoping to find a person or people with whine I can exchange ketamine depression treatment experiences. I‚Äôve been on nasal Spravato for 13 months. It‚Äôs been transformative in positive ways. It also seems to have unlocked some memories and feelings that I went to therapy to help with. But that latter part doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs going well. I do overall feel less awful each day. 

Anyone want to talk here or DM?",1120
L-Tryptophan - side effects?,"Have recently started 500mg at night to help with sleep as advised by doctor. Also take 7.5mg zopiclone. Initially started as parnate gave me extreme insomnia. Have had to come off parnate and am now taking 300mg Moclobemide (for 1 month and seeing no improvements). 

I have been having bad dreams every night and tonight as I was going to sleep almost felt like I was tripping out inbetween sleeping and waking over a short time. I am trying to figure out what is causing this. 

Has anyone experienced side effects from L-Tryptophan? Or would the cause likely be from Moclobemide (I wanna come off it). Just don‚Äôt wanna stop L-Tryptophan and then go downhill (I have severe depression).

Thanks guys",1121
5-HTP and SSRI,"Hi,  
I currently take 20mg of citalopram (celexa) daily and have off and on been supplementing with 5-HTP alongside it. I then read that it is 'dangerous' and can cause 'serotonin syndrome'.  
Since learning this I've stopped taking it, but having tested it again recently, I've noticed that 100mg 5-HTP (50mg of Tryptophan) has really positive effects for me. If I stop taking it, I feel really depressed and get the usual SSRI WD symptoms like brain zaps so it's clearly not placebo.  
Would 1 or doses of 5-HTP at this dose a day really be dangerous? I know it doesn't cause serotonin syndrome for me at this dose as I've taken quite a bit more than this before I found out it was 'dangerous'.  
This is simply the only thing that ACTUALLY works for me so as you can imagine I'm hesitant to give up on the supplement/combination that actually helps treat my depression.   
If your response is 'do not take it is definitely very dangerous' I'd appreciate any other suggestions that might work instead?  
Thanks",1122
Still looking for the magic bullet that is not an SSRI,"Long story kinda short: was on a low dose benzodiazepine and LOW dose Zoloft for 22 years. Did fairly well. Was motivated, enjoyed many activities but not all. Had some partial erectile dysfunction a couple of years ago and went off the Zoloft (it was only 20mg/day, over that and my nervousness got out of hand and was 24/7). Felt fine for about 8 months off it (still was on the benzo), then I started to notice a blah feeling, flat, things were not as enjoyable. That slowly worsened in the winter until I had a real depressive episode. Tried tryptophan, it was a mixed bag and gave me some autonomic issues and some insomnia. Then tried to get on the zoloft again, and even a low dose was horrible the 2nd time around. Heart issues, postural tachycardia that was bad in the mornings, insomnia worsened, blood pressure went up significantly. So I quit the zoloft again. 

I tried some different supplements (a slow tapering off on the benzo to this day), and felt fairly good for a couple of months. Now it seems like every time I try a supplement that ""works"" it helps for a month or two and then I'm back to my same flat, unenjoyable state. I sometimes even get brief thoughts of why is life worth living if I can't enjoy it. It seems like I simply cannot appreciate what I have for some reason. It's all there in front of me but I can't enjoy it or be content with it. 

The supplements that originally helped were 1000mg/day Niacinamide, then 650mg/day Betaine/Trimetylglycine. Now I'm popping 25mg straight Niacin sometimes, and that boosts mood quickly but it's temporary. I don't want to get a tolerance for it and start taking it like 6 times a day, but maybe I'll have to in order to keep my mood at a certain level. On the flip side, I'm 1/2 done tapering off the benzodiazepine and am doing fairly well with that, better than I thought. So basically I have a low mood without prominent anxiety now (used to be the opposite 25 years ago). 

Any suggestions for someone who doesn't do well at all with SSRI's. ",1123
"Nightmares from Cipralex never stopped, HELP!","For 7yrs now, every single time I sleep/nap I have incredibly vivid & intense dreams & nightmares.
