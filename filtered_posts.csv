Getting my laughter and sense of joy back with citalopram ,"I started citalopram again almost 2 weeks ago for anxiety, depression, and OCD and after some brutal side effects Iâ€™ve finally noticed a positive change. I know it takes 3-4 weeks for it to start taking full effect, but, I canâ€™t deny the bit of joy Iâ€™m finally starting to find again. For years Iâ€™ve felt like I donâ€™t really laugh much or it takes a lot to actually spark a laugh. Yesterday dad and I went to an amusement park and the amount of giggles I was getting on the rides was something I havenâ€™t experienced for so long. Like uncontrollable amounts. Heâ€™s also noticed it in general conversations and that Iâ€™m starting to find my joy again. Iâ€™m really happy that I took the steps to be medicated again and improve my quality of life. I finally feel like I deserve it :â€™)",d97d5d2a74f7071c45711511c9ba9dc30be6348171872afa3de97f58cba5dc7a
Can 10mg of Citalopram a day can cause serotonin syndrome?,"Been on it for more than a week. I haven't experienced side effects other than insomnia, but today afternoon I started to feel extremely tired and a bit dizzy. Then a few hours later I felt really hot and weak and sweating like hell (it's not hot at all inside, I have AC running). 
I feel a bit better now, but my BP is 145 (usually between 110 and 125 for me)

I'm worried as hell and started shaking. Will this shit kill me?",a0a957215de7024bcda162e55f33e50598a3dac859aa78aac65bcb8df0d7f29e
Tapering off Celexa question,"So I have been taking Celexa 40mg for about 15 years for generalized anxiety disorder. When I first started it I was having terrible anxiety and panic attacks. That went away but the whole time I have always maintained a mild anxiety that I feel I can live with. Tried Effexor and Zoloft and they didn't help about 10 years ago.

So I decided to come off them. For the past 1.5 months I have went from 40 > 30 > 20 > 10 > now 5mg tonight. The whole time I have had zero symptoms and no worsening of anxiety. So my question is, how low should I go before stopping altogether? I am taking 5mg because I have 10mg pills that are easy to cut in half. But after that I don't know what to do.

Any help would be appreciated. My psychologist has retired.

Thanks.",83da34fed7e134a88eda836c513804bae73159b28934d4d6ca7025f0cb72cea5

Citalopram,"Hey Iâ€™ve been on citalopram for like 2 months now - before I started taking it I really struggled with falling asleep but now I literally sleep every night for 15 hours - I find it impossible to wake myself up at the right time and Iâ€™m tired even after I wake up 

Is anyone on here prescribed citalopram for depression/anxiety and if so do you have this problem ",c175f03202fb0ea597d2970adb1be328b56d9b2c69d39bc638863ba1f2cc5c9a
Prozac to Celexa?,"Hi all, my dr is suggesting I switch from Prozac to celexa because Iâ€™ve been on Prozac for years and it doesnâ€™t seem to be helping much anymore. I also have a weight issue and itâ€™s possible celexa will help curb my appetite. Have any of you had experience with celexa and losing weight (and fighting your depression)? Thank you!
