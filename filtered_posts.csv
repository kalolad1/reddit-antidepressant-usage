Getting my laughter and sense of joy back with citalopram ,I started citalopram again almost 2 weeks ago for anxiety, depression, and OCD and after some brutal side effects I‚Äôve finally noticed a positive change. I know it takes 3-4 weeks for it to start taking full effect, but, I can‚Äôt deny the bit of joy I‚Äôm finally starting to find again. For years I‚Äôve felt like I don‚Äôt really laugh much or it takes a lot to actually spark a laugh. Yesterday my boyfriend and I went to an amusement park and the amount of giggles I was getting on the rides was something I haven‚Äôt experienced for so long. Like uncontrollable amounts. He‚Äôs also noticed it in general conversations and that I‚Äôm starting to find my joy again. I‚Äôm really happy that I took the steps to be medicated again and improve my quality of life. I finally feel like I deserve it :‚Äô)
Can 10mg of Citalopram a day can cause serotonin syndrome?,Been on it for more than a week. I haven't experienced side effects other than insomnia, but today afternoon I started to feel extremely tired and a bit dizzy. Then a few hours later I felt really hot and weak and sweating like hell (it's not hot at all inside, I have AC running). 
I feel a bit better now, but my BP is 145 (usually between 110 and 125 for me)

I'm worried as hell and started shaking. Will this shit kill me?
Has anyone tried Celexa?,Ikr doctor just prescribed me 20mg of celexa and I just started taking it yesterday:. When I took it this morning, i felt super nauseous so I ate something to calm my stomach. I haven‚Äôt thrown up but I‚Äôve been nauseous on and off all day today. Is this normal? Will it go away?? I don‚Äôt feel that great. I know it‚Äôs TMI but my stomach is all messed up today too and I normally  üí© once a day but since I took my medicine, I‚Äôve had 5 loose stools today. 
Citalopram/Celexa fatigue,I have been on celexa for about a year now. I remember in the beginning I had fatigue kinda bad but that was expected. Now, a year in, I fall asleep once or twice a day. It feels like I literally cannot fight the fatigue when it hits me. And half of the time I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôve fallen asleep until I wake up. And I‚Äôm sure I could fall asleep standing if I wanted to. It‚Äôs so bad. And I hate it. It makes me miss out on time with my son because my fianc√© will let me sleep, which I‚Äôm grateful for, but I‚Äôm tired of sleeping my days away. 

Idk if this will help at all but I am 23(F). I‚Äôve been fighting depression and anxiety for 3 years now and this is my third medication. And I take my medication at night before I go to bed.
Escitalopram,Hi All, 
First time poster, anyone ever have a hard time having a social drink while using Escitalopram? Not even a massive night, just a couple of social drinks and then feeling poorly for a couple days after?
Lexapro Withdrawal,I've been taking Lexapro 10mg for at least the last 2 years. I ran out recently and was unable to request a refill from my doctor's office (long story) so I decided that since I was planning on discontinuing it sooner rather than later, that I would take this as an opportunity to stop taking it. Now believe me, I KNOW quitting an antidepressant like Lexapro cold turkey is never a good idea, but it was out of my control.   
The withdrawal symptoms (brain zaps when I look in either direction horizontally, dizziness, irritability, random crying spells, etc) are truly awful. It's been about a week since I stopped taking it, so I'm hoping the worst of it will be over within the next week, but I'm not sure what to expect. I'm hoping someone else here has experience with quitting -whether cold turkey or not- who can tell me what their experience was and how long it took for the withdrawal symptoms to go away or at least become non-debilitating.

Thank you in advance!!

How was your experience on cipralex?,I have a question? I recently started cirpalex & its giving me side effects but my questions is... bow were your dreams while using cipralex? Just a question I was wondering about üòä I've only read about the dream thing today and now I'm curious 
Lexapro/cipralex- do you have any experience?,Hello Everyone!
I‚Äôm on week 5 of taking cipralex, two weeks on 10 mg. Escitalopam. Also known as Lexapro.
I have some questions. I still feel more tired than I was before taking cipralex, even though it‚Äôs better than at the begging. Did you feel the same as I? When did you stop feeling tired? I‚Äôm scared it will be still like this:/
And also did you study while taking Cipralex? There are final exams  ahead of me at university and I‚Äôm scared that it will somehow influence my memory, ability of studying at all :/

Some support and experience are appreciated ‚ô•Ô∏è
Citalopram ,Has Citalopram made anyone‚Äôs depression worse? I‚Äôm on 10 mg
Citalopram,Hey I‚Äôve been on citalopram for like 2 months now - before I started taking it I really struggled with falling asleep but now I literally sleep every night for 15 hours - I find it impossible to wake myself up at the right time and I‚Äôm tired even after I wake up 

Is anyone on here prescribed citalopram for depression/anxiety and if so do you have this problem 
Prozac to Celexa?,Hi all, my dr is suggesting I switch from Prozac to celexa because I‚Äôve been on Prozac for years and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping much anymore. I also have a weight issue and it‚Äôs possible celexa will help curb my appetite. Have any of you had experience with celexa and losing weight (and fighting your depression)? Thank you! 
Advice on anti depressants?,I've been off anti depressants for about 5 years because the side effects of low sex drive  and ED just made me really unhappy anyway.

But as it turns out, those side effects are pretty much irrelevant for me now as the illness has basically stopped me me even trying to meet women, so what does it matter? I just want to feel better, so thinking of going back on the one I was on (cipramil) but wondering if there any suggestions out there about which anti depressants worked for you and which ones didn't?
Escitalopram not working anymore?,Anyone else experience this and what other med were you prescribed
Lexapro,Sometimes I wonder if my lexapro is actually helping or not. We'll roughly a week ago I ran out and I can say for absolute certainty, it definitely does help!
Lexapro,I have been on 10 MG of lrxapro for 10 years. Originally needed for generalized anxiety. I didn't shed a tear when my parents died. I hardly reacted to any sad event. I decided to wean off. I am finally off and I cry a lot when appropriate  but my family criticizes me. They don't like I have feelings. This is wierd. I'm 73. Is this normal?
I am taking escitalopram (cipralex) for 2 months now and I really want to stop,Hello. 25M here, and I never in my life experienced a depression episode until 6 months ago because of a very tough breakup, 2 months ago things were at their worst with severe insomnia and anxiety attacks so i considered ssri because nothing else really worked. I got constant support from family and friends and that made me feel relieved. 

I was really scared of these pills at first, because I am the kind of person that reads the whole prescription to ibuprofen to see if it's fine to take it in certain situations, so started taking cipralex and nausea and numbness kicked in the first days. Then, after some time I started gaining weight even if I was running an hour a day. Time passed for 2 months now and I can say I really am the person I was before this pill with some sad episodes here and there that I had even before the breakup. The sleep is back the anxiety really is gone. 

But there some side effects to this pill that really scare me, i feel like an empty shell emotionless human right now, that cannot empathise enough as I did before, I do not feel any emotions before nor I can laugh or even cry a little bit like before. 

I know the minimum to feel better is 6 months, and my psichiatrist keeps insisting on taking them like they are candy, but I can't handle that because I am an outgoing person that wants to have fun and feel the joys of life as i felt before them. Summer is coming up and I can't drink an ounce of alcohol because of them, nor feel the laughter i had without them, because I know I was a happy person and I can reach back the way I was and even better.

So here is with the question, I really do not think this would give me another episode as I really do feel fine, I want to taper them already and leave them for good. I know myself and the kind of person I was before this breakup and I can say that I have found myself again. I know going cold-turkey is the worst thing you can do, so i want to tapper them as normal to not experience withdrawals. Do you have any advise on this?

Shortage of breath with Cipralex(Escitalopram),Since a few weeks my problems with breath shortage have become worse.
I have raisen my dosage up to 20mg with permission by the psychiatrist.

I thought it may be related with long periods of laying down in bed, but I tried to walk everyday my 3000-5000 steps or something and (do some sports once a week), so I guess there is another main problem...

Maybe it can be related to some allergic reaction?
Does someone has experience with it?
